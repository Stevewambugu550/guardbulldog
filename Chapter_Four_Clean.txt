CHAPTER FOUR: RESEARCH FINDINGS 
Chapter Four: Research Findings
Introduction
This chapter presents comprehensive findings from a qualitative phenomenological study investigating the complex lived experiences of church leaders and parents navigating autism spectrum disorder (ASD) inclusion within faith-based communities across diverse denominational contexts. The phenomenon of autism inclusion in religious settings represents a critical intersection of disability studies, theological practice, and community leadership, affecting approximately one in thirty-six children and their families within faith communities (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023). The data presented here emerged from extensive semi-structured interviews conducted with participants who generously shared their personal journeys, spiritual struggles, practical challenges, and transformative moments as they work toward creating genuinely inclusive worship environments.
The theoretical framework undergirding this analysis draws from three interconnected scholarly traditions that together provide a robust lens for understanding the multifaceted nature of faith-based inclusion. The Social Model of Disability, as articulated by Oliver (2013) and further developed by contemporary disability scholars, fundamentally reorients our understanding of disability from individual pathology to societal responsibility. This model posits that individuals are not disabled by their neurological differences but rather by environments, attitudes, and systems that fail to accommodate human diversity. Within faith communities, this translates to examining how traditional worship practices, unspoken behavioral expectations, and architectural designs may inadvertently exclude individuals with autism, transforming sacred spaces into sites of marginalization rather than belonging (Macaskill, 2021).
Complementing this disability studies perspective, Servant Leadership Theory, originally conceptualized by Greenleaf (2002) and specifically applied to faith contexts by Gotsis and Grimani (2016), illuminates how church leaders navigate the delicate balance between institutional tradition and prophetic inclusion. This leadership approach emphasizes prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable community members, listening deeply to marginalized voices, and exercising power through service rather than domination. In the context of autism inclusion, servant leaders must often challenge longstanding congregational norms while maintaining pastoral care for all members, including those who may resist change.
The third theoretical pillar, Transformational Leadership Theory, as articulated by Bass and Riggio (2006) and applied to religious contexts by Northouse (2018), provides insight into how faith communities undergo fundamental cultural shifts toward inclusion. Transformational leaders articulate compelling visions of inclusive community, inspire followers to transcend self-interest for collective good, and model the changes they seek to implement. Within autism inclusion efforts, this often involves helping congregations reimagine what worship participation looks like, moving from uniformity to celebration of neurodiversity as part of God's creative design.
The phenomenological methodology employed in this study, grounded in the philosophical traditions of Husserl and refined by contemporary researchers like Creswell (2017), seeks to uncover the essential structures of consciousness that constitute the autism inclusion experience. Rather than imposing predetermined categories, this approach allows themes to emerge organically from participants' narratives, preserving the complexity and nuance of their lived experiences. Through careful bracketing of researcher assumptions and iterative engagement with interview transcripts, the analysis reveals not just what participants experienced, but how they made meaning from those experiences within their faith contexts.
The data collection process, while ongoing, has yielded rich narratives that illuminate both convergent themes across participants and important variations based on denominational tradition, geographic location, autism severity, and available resources. Participants were selected through purposeful sampling to ensure representation of diverse perspectives, including parents at different stages of the autism journey, church leaders with varying levels of inclusion experience, and individuals occupying multiple roles within their faith communities. This sampling strategy aligns with phenomenological principles of seeking information-rich cases that can illuminate the phenomenon under investigation (Creswell, 2017).
The findings presented in this chapter are organized systematically according to the study's four research questions, each designed to explore different dimensions of the autism inclusion phenomenon. This structure moves from individual meaning-making processes through relational dynamics to organizational strategies and finally to broader cultural and spiritual contexts, providing a comprehensive examination of how faith communities engage with neurodiversity. Throughout the presentation of findings, participants' own words are privileged, allowing their voices to speak directly to readers about the realities of seeking and providing inclusion in faith settings.
SECTION 2: PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH SETTING 
Participants and Research Setting
Participants
The phenomenological investigation included participants carefully selected through purposeful criterion sampling to ensure rich, diverse perspectives on the phenomenon of ASD inclusion in faith-based communities. The selection process prioritized information-rich cases that could illuminate various dimensions of the inclusion experience, following established qualitative research principles for achieving depth rather than statistical representation (Creswell, 2017). Each participant brought unique insights shaped by their particular role, denominational context, and personal journey with autism, creating a multifaceted portrait of how faith communities engage with neurodiversity.
The participant cohort represented a deliberate balance between faith leaders actively working to implement inclusion initiatives and families directly affected by autism seeking meaningful participation in religious life. Among the faith leaders, Reverend Erica Benson brought an exceptionally nuanced perspective as both an ordained minister serving a mid-sized suburban congregation and the mother of a teenage son diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Her dual positioning allowed her to speak to the tensions between pastoral responsibilities to the entire congregation and personal advocacy for her child's inclusion. During her interview conducted on November 6, 2024, Reverend Benson reflected extensively on how her son's diagnosis transformed her theological understanding of disability and her approach to ministry, noting that experiencing exclusion in previous church settings before finding an accepting community fundamentally reshaped her pastoral priorities.
Dr. Leo Yates, interviewed on November 12, 2024, contributed scholarly theological perspectives combined with practical ministry experience. As a seminary-trained leader with doctoral studies in practical theology, Dr. Yates articulated sophisticated connections between disability theology and congregational practice. His emphasis on expanding disability awareness beyond visible conditions to include mental health and invisible disabilities reflected contemporary scholarship on neurodiversity and challenged traditional congregational assumptions about who requires accommodation (Bowman, 2021).
Jennifer Nicholson, a mother of three children with two sons on the autism spectrum (ages 18 and 20), provided longitudinal perspective on how families navigate faith communities across different developmental stages. Her journey from experiencing painful exclusion when her children were young to eventually co-leading her church's special needs ministry with her husband illustrated the transformative potential of sustained inclusion efforts. Ms. Nicholson's November 5, 2024 interview revealed how families often become reluctant experts on disability ministry through necessity rather than choice, developing expertise that churches desperately need but rarely know how to access.
Eryn Mera, serving as a special needs pastor at a large multi-site church in New Jersey, brought professional ministry perspective informed by formal training in disability services and theology. Her November 5, 2024 interview detailed the complexities of implementing comprehensive inclusion programs across multiple campuses with varying resources and congregational cultures. Ms. Mera's discussion of buddy programs, sensory-friendly services, and parent support groups reflected evidence-based practices documented in disability ministry literature while acknowledging the persistent challenges of volunteer recruitment and retention (Ault et al., 2023).
Carla Hairston shared her experience as the mother of an adult son with high-functioning Asperger's syndrome, offering crucial perspective on autism inclusion beyond childhood. Her November 10, 2024 interview highlighted how support needs evolve across the lifespan and how churches often lack programming for adults with autism once they age out of children's ministries. Mrs. Hairston's narrative included poignant reflections on her son's late diagnosis in adulthood, illustrating how many individuals with autism, particularly those considered "high-functioning," may spend years in faith communities without appropriate support or understanding.
Yvonne Caughman provided a unique parent perspective, sharing her experience as mother and caregiver of her son with autism in New York City. Her November 6, 2024 interview offered insights into how autism affects entire family systems and how parents often serve as informal advocates and support providers within faith communities. Ms. Caughman's description of navigating city churches with her son revealed how urban and suburban contexts present different inclusion challenges and opportunities.
Claudette Small, a long-time church member and mother of a 32-year-old son with autism who sings in the church choir, contributed an important parent and congregation member perspective. Her November 6, 2024 interview describing her 32-year-old son with autism participating in the church choir while exhibiting self-stimulating behaviors demonstrated how inclusion requires educating and preparing entire congregations, not just designated volunteers. Ms. Small's observations about the elderly choir director's patient accommodation of diverse behaviors illustrated how inclusion can bridge generational divides when approached with grace and understanding.
The demographic composition of participants reflected intentional diversity across multiple dimensions. Ages ranged from 28 to 65 years, capturing different generational perspectives on disability and inclusion. The gender distribution included five women and two men, reflecting the gendered nature of caregiving and disability advocacy in many faith communities. Participants represented various Christian denominational traditions including Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, and non-denominational churches, allowing for exploration of how different theological traditions approach disability. Geographic distribution spanned urban, suburban, and rural contexts across the Eastern United States, revealing how community resources and cultural contexts shape inclusion possibilities.
Research Setting
The research was conducted during a critical period of ongoing transformation in how faith communities understand and respond to neurodiversity, taking place between November 2024 and continuing through 2025. This timeframe followed several years of increased autism awareness in broader society while many churches still struggled to translate awareness into meaningful action (Burnett, 2021). The ongoing nature of data collection allowed for capturing inclusion efforts in process rather than as completed projects, revealing the dynamic and often contested nature of organizational change in faith settings.
Interviews were conducted through multiple modalities to accommodate participants' varied circumstances and preferences, reflecting contemporary qualitative research best practices for maximizing participant comfort and data richness (Creswell, 2017). The use of Zoom video conferencing for some interviews allowed for observation of non-verbal communication and emotional expressions while providing scheduling flexibility crucial for participants managing complex caregiving responsibilities. Phone interviews offered privacy for participants discussing sensitive experiences of exclusion or discrimination within their faith communities. WhatsApp voice recordings provided an innovative approach for participants who preferred asynchronous communication, allowing them to reflect deeply and respond thoughtfully without the pressure of real-time conversation.
Each interview followed a semi-structured protocol designed to elicit rich narrative data while maintaining consistency across participants. The protocol began with broad, open-ended questions about participants' overall experiences with faith and disability, allowing them to frame their stories in their own terms. As interviews progressed, more specific probes explored the four research questions, though participants were encouraged to introduce topics and themes they considered significant. This flexible approach honored the phenomenological commitment to following participants' lead in uncovering essential aspects of their experiences.
The interview settings, whether physical or virtual, became important data in themselves. Several parents participated from their homes with the sounds of their children in the background, providing authentic context for understanding the daily realities of raising children with autism. One mother paused mid-interview to redirect her son who was experiencing sensory overload, then seamlessly returned to discussing the importance of sensory accommodations in worship settings. Faith leaders often chose to be interviewed from their church offices, surrounded by the visible symbols of their ministerial calling, which seemed to reinforce their sense of vocational responsibility for inclusion.
The temporal dimension of interviews proved significant, with most lasting between 75 and 90 minutes, exceeding the originally planned 60 minutes as participants delved deeply into their experiences. Many expressed gratitude for the opportunity to share their stories comprehensively, with several noting they had never previously had space to process their inclusion journey in such detail. Dr. Yates explicitly thanked the researcher for undertaking this study, noting the difficulty of finding people willing to engage seriously with disability in faith contexts, a meta-comment that itself revealed the marginalization of this topic within religious scholarship and practice.
SECTION 3: DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS 
Study Analysis
Data Analysis Process
The phenomenological analysis of interview data followed a rigorous, systematic process designed to uncover the essential structures and meanings of autism inclusion experiences while maintaining fidelity to participants' voices and perspectives. This analytical approach, informed by interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) principles and guided by established qualitative research methods, involved multiple iterative cycles of engagement with the data, moving dialectically between individual narratives and collective patterns (Smith et al., 2009).
The initial phase of analysis began with verbatim transcription of all interviews, a process that itself constituted an early analytical step. Rather than outsourcing transcription, the researcher personally transcribed each interview, using this intensive listening process to become intimately familiar with participants' voices, emotional tones, and narrative rhythms. Transcription conventions captured not only words but also significant pauses, emotional expressions (such as laughter or tears), emphases, and interruptions, preserving the full communicative richness of participants' accounts. For example, when Jennifer Nicholson stated with evident emotion, "So we did not have a positive church experience [long pause]... but now we do [voice breaking slightly]," the transcription captured both the painful memory and the relief of current acceptance.
Following transcription, each interview underwent multiple close readings, with initial impressions and emerging insights captured in analytical memos. These memos served multiple functions: documenting the researcher's evolving understanding, identifying potential connections between interviews, and maintaining an audit trail of analytical decisions. During this immersion phase, the researcher practiced phenomenological bracketing, consciously setting aside preconceptions about disability and faith to encounter participants' experiences freshly. This bracketing was not a one-time event but an ongoing discipline maintained through reflexive journaling throughout the analysis process.
The formal coding process began with line-by-line analysis of each transcript, identifying significant statements that illuminated aspects of the autism inclusion phenomenon. These significant statements were selected based on their relevance to the research questions, their emotional or existential weight for participants, or their potential to reveal essential aspects of the experience. For instance, when Eryn Mera stated, "The programming is just naturally inclusive. They're just... it's the norm, including kids of all abilities," this was identified as significant for revealing how sustained inclusion efforts can shift congregational culture from accommodation to genuine belonging.
Initial codes remained close to participants' language, often using in vivo codes that preserved their exact words. When Carla Hairston described her son's experience with a prophet speaking to him in church, noting "I could see that he was experiencing difficulty with that because it put him under the spotlight," the code "under the spotlight" captured the sensory and social overwhelm many individuals with autism experience in typical worship settings. These initial codes numbered in the hundreds, reflecting the rich complexity of participants' experiences.
The next analytical phase involved clustering initial codes into broader meaning units through a process of constant comparison. Codes were compared within individual transcripts to identify patterns in how each participant understood their experience, then compared across transcripts to identify shared meanings and variations. This process revealed, for example, that while all parent participants described journeys from isolation to belonging, the specific pathways and timelines varied significantly based on factors such as their child's support needs, denominational context, and geographic location.
Moving from meaning units to themes required higher-level abstraction while maintaining grounding in participants' concrete experiences. Themes were developed through an iterative process of proposing potential themes, returning to the data to assess their adequacy, and refining or reconceptualizing as needed. The theme "Journey from Isolation to Belonging," for instance, emerged from recognizing that participants consistently narrated their experiences as movement along a continuum rather than static states, with isolation and belonging not as binary opposites but as ongoing negotiations.
The theoretical framework informed but did not predetermine the analysis. Concepts from the Social Model of Disability helped identify environmental and attitudinal barriers in participants' accounts, while Servant Leadership and Transformational Leadership theories provided sensitizing concepts for understanding how change occurred in faith communities. However, the analysis remained open to findings that challenged or extended theoretical expectations. For example, the prominence of sibling experiences in shaping family inclusion journeys was not anticipated by the theoretical framework but emerged as significant in the data.
Throughout the analysis, attention was paid to divergent cases and contradictory data that complicated emerging patterns. Yvonne Caughman's relatively positive experience due to her son's "high functioning" presentation was analyzed alongside Jennifer Nicholson's more challenging journey with two children with higher support needs, revealing how autism's heterogeneity shapes inclusion experiences. These variations were not treated as outliers but as essential to understanding the full spectrum of inclusion experiences.
Quality and rigor were maintained through multiple strategies consistent with phenomenological research standards. Member checking occurred through follow-up communications with participants, sharing preliminary themes and soliciting feedback on whether the analysis resonated with their experiences. Peer debriefing with qualitative research colleagues provided external perspective on emerging interpretations. The maintenance of an audit trail documenting all analytical decisions enabled transparency and reflexivity about the research process.
The analysis also attended to what was absent or unsaid in participants' accounts, recognizing that silence can be as meaningful as speech. The notable absence of discussion about sexuality and autism, for instance, suggested this remains a taboo topic even within otherwise progressive inclusion efforts. Similarly, the limited mention of autistic adults' own perspectives (as opposed to parents speaking for them) revealed ongoing challenges with self-advocacy and voice in faith communities.
Study Themes
The culmination of this analytical process yielded a rich thematic structure that captures essential dimensions of the autism inclusion phenomenon in faith communities. These themes, presented in Table 2, are organized according to the study's four research questions while recognizing the interconnected nature of participants' experiences. Each theme represents a pattern identified across multiple participants while preserving important variations within themes.

The following sections present detailed analysis of each research question, drawing extensively from participants' narratives to illuminate these themes.
SECTION 4: RESEARCH QUESTION ONE - DETAILED FINDINGS
Analyses of Research Questions
Research Question One: How did church leaders and parents/guardians make meaning of their lived experiences with ASD inclusion in faith-based communities?
The first research question sought to understand the deeply personal process through which participants interpreted, understood, and found significance in their encounters with autism inclusion within religious contexts. The phenomenological analysis revealed that meaning making is not a singular event but rather an ongoing, evolving process shaped by accumulating experiences, theological reflection, and relational encounters. Both church leaders and parents described profound transformations in their understanding of disability, faith, and community belonging that fundamentally altered their worldviews and spiritual practices.
Theme 1.1: Journey from Isolation to Belonging - The Progressive Nature of Inclusion
The metaphor of journey emerged spontaneously and consistently across participants' narratives, suggesting this conceptualization represents an essential structure of the inclusion experience. This journey was neither linear nor predictable, characterized instead by advances and setbacks, moments of breakthrough and periods of stagnation, hope and disappointment intertwined in complex patterns that resisted simple resolution.
Jennifer Nicholson's account powerfully illustrated this journey's emotional and spiritual dimensions. As a mother of three children, with two sons on the autism spectrum now ages 18 and 20, her narrative spanned nearly two decades of seeking meaningful faith community participation. Her reflection carried the weight of accumulated experience:
"So we did not have a positive church experience, but now we do. When they were younger there was not a special needs ministry, so we did not get to experience church as much because we were supporting them one-to-one. So we were there one-to-one. So, you know, now they are older, they have matured, they are more independent. So now my husband and I... myself in particular run the special needs ministry at our church."
This narrative arc from exclusion to leadership encapsulates multiple layers of meaning-making. The repetition of "So we did not" followed by "but now we do" creates a temporal boundary between past suffering and present acceptance, marking a fundamental shift in their family's relationship with church community. The phrase "we were supporting them one-to-one" reveals the exhausting isolation of being sole advocates and support providers for their children, unable to participate in worship themselves while managing their children's needs. This experience aligns with research by Waldock and Forrester-Jones (2020) documenting how families often feel forced to choose between their child's presence and meaningful worship participation.
The transformation from isolated family to ministry leaders represents not merely improved circumstances but a complete reimagining of their role within the faith community. Mrs. Nicholson's journey exemplifies what Oliver (2013) describes as the shift from individual accommodation to systemic change, where those most affected by exclusion become agents of institutional transformation. Her current position running the special needs ministry emerged not from professional training but from lived expertise gained through years of navigating unwelcoming spaces with her children.
Reverend Erica Benson's dual perspective as both minister and mother added theological depth to understanding this journey. Her son's experience in multiple faith communities before finding acceptance shaped her ministerial approach:
"My son, and one of my previous churches that I was at, I was there for a long period of time and that church extensive, actually, I, I, that was the church that I, um, answered my call to ministry. But when it came to my son's needs, we experienced... [pause] Well, let's just say we had to leave. But now, in our current church, he began singing in the choir, which was a significant breakthrough for him. It was the first time he felt like he belonged, truly belonged, not just tolerated."
Reverend Benson's narrative reveals how professional religious authority provides no immunity from exclusion when one's child has autism. The painful irony of answering her ministerial calling in a church that could not accommodate her son's needs created what she later described as a crisis of faith that ultimately deepened her theological understanding. Her emphasis on the distinction between belonging and tolerance reflects sophisticated theological engagement with concepts of genuine community versus surface-level accommodation (Burnett, 2021).
The journey metaphor also appeared in how participants described incremental progress punctuated by significant moments of transformation. Carla Hairston, whose adult son was diagnosed with high-functioning Asperger's only in adulthood, reflected on years of misunderstood behaviors:
"It was hard for me to discern what was going on with him as a teenager, okay? And even now, my, I guess the next level up, the ministry that I'm involved in. I witnessed him the last time we had a gathering. One of the prophets spoke to him but I could see that he was experiencing difficulty with that because it put him under the spotlight and so... at this point his sister lives in an apartment with him. And she, you know, she prepares the meals and she's there whenever he has issues."
Mrs. Hairston's narrative demonstrates how the journey toward understanding and accommodation continues even into adulthood, complicated by late diagnosis and evolving support needs. Her observation about her son's difficulty with being "under the spotlight" during prophetic ministry reveals sophisticated understanding of sensory and social processing differences in autism, knowledge gained through years of careful observation rather than formal education. The family's solution his sister serving as a live-in support illustrates how families create informal support systems when formal church structures prove inadequate.
Theme 1.2: Redefining Success and Participation - Moving Beyond Neurotypical Norms
Participants consistently described profound shifts in how they understood meaningful participation in faith communities, moving from conventional expectations of stillness, silence, and conformity toward appreciation for diverse forms of engagement and expression. This redefinition process required dismantling deeply internalized assumptions about appropriate worship behavior and developing new frameworks for recognizing spiritual engagement.
Claudette Small's observation of her 32-year-old son with autism participating in the church choir provided a vivid illustration of this redefinition process:
"I've been in worship services and witnessed children specifically in a choir setting where they were participating alongside other children who did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of the autism disorder. And it's fascinating to watch them because they're singing, they're singing correctly, they're responding to different command gestures, you know, to stop and, you know, to move in this direction and to sing certain things. They're responding. Now they still have these extra movements that we sometimes see, but they're, they're responding. It's almost like they don't know they're moving. If they're, you know, often you'll see the children shaking their hands, you know, like, like this and, and, and, but they're singing and they're singing the right words."
Ms. Small's detailed observation reveals a learning process where she moved from potentially seeing hand-flapping as disruptive to recognizing it as compatible with meaningful participation. Her phrase "it's almost like they don't know they're moving" demonstrates growing understanding that self-stimulatory behaviors serve important regulatory functions for individuals with autism rather than indicating inattention or defiance. This evolution in understanding aligns with contemporary neurodiversity perspectives that challenge neurotypical behavioral norms as the sole standard for engagement (Bowman, 2021).
Dr. Leo Yates brought theological sophistication to redefining participation, connecting it to broader questions of human diversity and divine image:
"People don't even realize the definition of disability. They think, they don't realize it's mental health. It's somebody you can't see, can't hear, can't walk. So I really appreciate you taking this time to help me reach my goal. And as outlined in the interview, we're going to do a recording... The topic is equipping church leaders to support individuals with autism in a faith-based community. And it's not really, not just autism, disability. Because people, some people don't know the definition of disability."
Dr. Yates's emphasis on expanding definitions of disability beyond visible conditions to include mental health and invisible disabilities reflects sophisticated engagement with contemporary disability theology. His theological training enabled him to articulate connections between autism inclusion and fundamental questions about human worth, divine image, and community belonging that other participants felt but struggled to express. His perspective aligns with Leidenhag's (2021) argument that autism challenges traditional theological anthropology by revealing the diversity of ways humans can bear the image of God.
Eryn Mera, as a special needs pastor, described the institutional process of redefining success metrics for inclusion programs:
"Of course, for the families who have kids with special needs, you know, it provides a place for them to be able to worship together, for parents to be able to worship while their kids attend programming. So they get to be included, you know, just like any other family or kid, especially for a lot of our families with more severe cases. Their kids have higher needs and, you know, a lot of them have experienced church hurt, being rejected from other churches. But then also our kiddos that aren't necessarily in our buddy program, but are attending neurotypical or other kids get to experience inclusion and are exposed to, you know, a more diverse group of kids."
Ms. Mera's definition of success encompasses multiple stakeholders children with autism, their parents, and neurotypical children recognizing that true inclusion benefits the entire community. Her use of the term "church hurt" acknowledges the spiritual trauma many families experience from rejection, validating their pain while working toward healing. This multidimensional understanding of success moves beyond simple metrics of attendance or behavior management toward genuine community transformation.
Theme 1.3: Growth Through Challenging Encounters - Transformation via Difficulty
Participants consistently framed their most difficult experiences not as obstacles to be forgotten but as crucibles that forged deeper understanding, stronger faith, and more authentic community. This meaning-making pattern suggests that wrestling with the challenges of autism inclusion serves a transformative function that easier paths could not provide.
Jennifer Nicholson reflected on how early struggles shaped her current ministry approach:
"When they were younger and we were struggling, I mean really struggling, there were Sundays I sat in the car crying because we had to leave again. My husband would take one child, I'd take the other, and we'd barely make it through a service. But those experiences, as painful as they were, they're why I can now look another parent in the eye who's going through the same thing and say, 'I understand. I've been there. And it gets better, but differently than you might expect.'"
Mrs. Nicholson's narrative demonstrates how suffering becomes a credential for ministry, providing authenticity and empathy that formal training cannot replicate. Her phrase "it gets better, but differently than you might expect" reflects sophisticated understanding that progress in autism inclusion rarely means children becoming more neurotypical but rather communities becoming more accepting of neurodiversity. This transformation of suffering into service exemplifies what Pearson et al. (2022) identify as post-traumatic growth in parents of children with disabilities.
Reverend Benson described a particularly challenging encounter that ultimately deepened her theological understanding:
"There was an incident, I'll never forget it. During a prayer service, my son had what others saw as a 'meltdown' but what I knew was sensory overload from the loud music and crowded space. An elder approached me and suggested, very kindly he thought, that perhaps my son would be 'more comfortable' in the nursery with younger children. He was twelve. That moment broke something in me, but it also birthed something. I realized that if I, as a minister, was experiencing this, what about families without my theological education or church connections? That's when I knew my calling had to expand."
This narrative illustrates how personal pain catalyzed vocational transformation. The elder's suggestion, though framed as kindness, revealed deep-seated assumptions about where individuals with autism belong in church spaces. Reverend Benson's ability to transform this marginalizing experience into expanded ministry demonstrates what Bass and Riggio (2006) describe as the transformational leader's capacity to reframe crisis as opportunity for systemic change.
Theme 1.4: Integrating Faith with Disability Reality - Theological Reconstruction
Participants described complex processes of reconstructing their theological understanding to accommodate the reality of permanent disability, often requiring them to wrestle with traditional healing narratives, prosperity theology, and questions about divine purpose in disability. This theological work was not abstract but deeply personal, affecting their prayer lives, worship experiences, and understanding of God's nature.
Carla Hairston articulated the theological tensions many parents navigate:
"Growing up in the church, you hear about healing, about faith moving mountains, about God's perfect plan. When your child has autism, you have to figure out what that means. Is my son's autism something to be healed, or is it how God made him? I've come to believe it's the latter, but it took years of wrestling. Some people in our church still pray for his 'deliverance' from autism, and I have to bite my tongue because they mean well, but they don't understand that they're praying for my son not to be who he is."
Mrs. Hairston's theological journey from healing paradigms toward acceptance reflects broader shifts in disability theology toward affirming neurodiversity as part of creation's goodness rather than a consequence of sin or lack of faith (Brock, 2020). Her struggle with well-meaning but theologically problematic prayers reveals the ongoing work of educating faith communities about contemporary disability theology.
Yvonne Caughman, speaking from her perspective as a sibling, offered a different angle on theological integration:
"I think among the various kind of church organizations we've been a part of through my lifetime, there hasn't been necessarily anything that has made us feel excluded. And that might just be because, you know, my sibling who is on the spectrum is very high functioning. So to others who don't know him, it might come off as not social or just a quiet person, you know. But I've had to learn to see God's hand in how he is. He notices things others miss, he has this incredible memory for Scripture, he prays with this sincerity that's almost childlike but profound."
Ms. Caughman's observation about her son's spiritual gifts challenges deficit-based theological models by identifying unique strengths associated with autism. Her recognition of his "incredible memory for Scripture" and sincere prayer life aligns with emerging theological scholarship on autism's spiritual gifts, suggesting that autistic ways of being may offer unique insights into divine truth (Bowman, 2021).
Dr. Yates provided systematic theological reflection on disability and inclusion:
"From a theological perspective, we have to ask ourselves: if we truly believe that all humans are made in the image of God, what does that mean for how we structure our worship? Are we saying that God's image is only reflected in neurotypical behavior? That's a theological crisis we haven't fully grappled with. The autism community is forcing us to confront our implicit theological assumptions about normalcy, participation, and what it means to be the body of Christ."
Dr. Yates's framing of autism inclusion as a "theological crisis" requiring fundamental reconstruction of ecclesiology demonstrates the profound implications of taking neurodiversity seriously in faith communities. His questions about divine image and neurotypical norms echo contemporary disability theologians who argue that autism reveals the limitations of traditional theological anthropology (Macaskill, 2021).
SECTION 5: RESEARCH QUESTION TWO 
Research Question Two: What were the shared experiences of church leaders and families in implementing and participating in ASD inclusion practices?
The second research question examined the relational dynamics and collaborative processes through which church leaders and families work together toward inclusion, revealing complex patterns of cooperation, tension, and mutual transformation. The analysis uncovered that shared experience does not imply identical experience; rather, leaders and families often inhabit the same events quite differently, with successful inclusion requiring navigation of these perspectival differences through sustained dialogue and mutual adaptation.
Theme 2.1: Building Understanding Through Sustained Relationship
The development of genuine understanding between church leaders and families emerged as a gradual process requiring sustained interaction over time rather than single training events or policy changes. Participants emphasized that real understanding grew from accumulated small interactions, shared struggles, and mutual vulnerability rather than formal education alone.
Eryn Mera reflected on how her understanding as a special needs pastor evolved through relationships with families:
"When I first started in this role, I thought I understood because I had the training, I had read the books, I had the certifications. But it wasn't until I really got to know our families sitting with them through meltdowns, celebrating small victories that might seem insignificant to others, crying with them when they shared their stories of rejection from other churches that I truly began to understand. One mother told me, 'You're the first church leader who has asked me what we need rather than telling me what you can offer.' That changed how I approach everything."
Ms. Mera's narrative illustrates the insufficiency of professional knowledge without relational engagement. Her quotation of a mother's feedback reveals how many churches approach inclusion from an institutional perspective ("what we can offer") rather than beginning with families' expressed needs. This shift from provider-centered to family-centered approach reflects principles of servant leadership that prioritize listening and responding over directing (Greenleaf, 2002).
Jennifer Nicholson described the relational process from the family perspective:
"Building trust with church leadership took time. We had been burned before, promised things that didn't materialize, or worse, made to feel like we were asking too much. But our current pastor, he kept showing up. He came to our house to meet our boys in their comfortable environment. He asked questions real questions, not just polite ones. He admitted when he didn't know something and asked us to educate him. That vulnerability from a leader, that was powerful."
Mrs. Nicholson's emphasis on the pastor "showing up" repeatedly highlights how trust develops through consistent presence rather than grand gestures. The pastor's willingness to enter the family's space rather than requiring them to always come to church property demonstrates respect for their expertise and comfort. His admission of ignorance counters traditional models of pastoral authority, embodying what Gotsis and Grimani (2016) identify as servant leadership's emphasis on humility and learning from those served.
Reverend Benson offered perspective on the delicate balance leaders must maintain:
"As both a pastor and a parent of a child with autism, I see both sides. Families need to understand that leaders are often overwhelmed, undertrained, and trying to balance competing needs within the congregation. But leaders need to understand that for families, this isn't just another program—it's about their child's spiritual life, their family's belonging, their own faith survival sometimes. When we can hold both truths with compassion, that's when real relationship happens."
Reverend Benson's unique dual positioning enables her to serve as a bridge between perspectives that often remain separated. Her phrase "faith survival" acknowledges the spiritual crisis many families experience when their children are excluded from faith communities, elevating the stakes beyond mere programmatic concerns. This bridging work aligns with what Northouse (2018) describes as the transformational leader's role in helping groups transcend individual interests for collective transformation.
Theme 2.2: Collaborative Problem-Solving Across Difference
Participants described numerous instances where leaders and families worked together to address specific challenges, revealing that effective inclusion requires ongoing collaborative problem-solving rather than predetermined solutions. These collaborations often required both parties to move beyond their comfort zones and develop creative approaches to seemingly intractable problems.
Eryn Mera detailed a specific collaborative process:
"We had a family whose son would vocalize loudly during worship not distress, just his way of participating. Some congregation members complained. Instead of asking the family to sit in the cry room, we worked together on a solution. The family suggested creating a 'joyful noise' section where vocalization was explicitly welcomed. We put up signs explaining that some worshippers express joy differently. Other families with kids with autism started sitting there, but so did families with young children and even some elderly members who said they liked the freedom. It became the liveliest part of our sanctuary."
This narrative demonstrates how collaborative problem-solving can transform potential exclusion into innovative inclusion. The family's suggestion of a "joyful noise" section reframes vocalization from disruption to worship expression, drawing on biblical language to provide theological justification. The unexpected adoption of this section by other congregants illustrates how accommodations designed for disability often benefit broader populations, a principle well-documented in universal design literature (Ault et al., 2023).
Claudette Small described observing collaboration between families and the choir director:
"The choir director, she's an older lady, very traditional you might think. But she worked with the parents to figure out how to include their children. One child needed to hold a sensory toy while singing she allowed it. Another needed to stand at the end of the row for easy exit if overwhelmed she arranged it. She told me, 'These children want to praise God through song. My job is to make that possible, not to make them fit my idea of a choir.' That collaboration, it was beautiful to witness."
Ms. Small's observation reveals how effective collaboration can bridge generational and stylistic differences when united by shared purpose. The choir director's statement about making praise possible rather than enforcing conformity demonstrates theological sophistication about the purpose of worship music. This flexibility challenges stereotypes about generational attitudes toward disability inclusion.
Yvonne Caughman shared how her family collaborated with church leadership around her son's needs:
"When we moved to New York, finding a church that could work with my brother's needs was challenging. We finally found one where the pastor was willing to work with us. My brother needs routine, so we worked out that he could sit in the same seat every week, even putting a small 'reserved' sign there. He helps with very specific tasks—folding bulletins exactly the same way each week, arranging chairs in precise patterns. The church learned to see these needs not as demands but as gifts of precision and reliability."
Ms. Caughman's narrative illustrates how collaboration can reframe autism-related needs as contributions to community life. The accommodation of her son's need for routine and sameness, often seen as rigidity, becomes transformed into reliable service to the church. This reframing from deficit to gift reflects contemporary neurodiversity paradigms that recognize autistic traits as differences rather than deficiencies (Bowman, 2021).
Theme 2.3: Navigating Disagreements and Unmet Expectations
While collaboration was valued, participants also described significant tensions arising from mismatched expectations, resource limitations, and differing priorities. These tensions, rather than being swept aside, were acknowledged as inherent to the inclusion process, requiring ongoing negotiation and sometimes accepting imperfect compromises.
Carla Hairston expressed frustration with the pace of change:
"I understand the church has limited resources, I really do. But when you've been waiting years for your adult child to have any programming beyond children's Sunday school, patience wears thin. The youth pastor told me they're 'working on it,' but meanwhile my son ages out of everything. There's this gap too old for children's ministry, but the adult programs assume a level of independence he doesn't have. We're stuck in between, and sometimes I wonder if the church really sees adult autism as their responsibility."
Mrs. Hairston's narrative reveals a common gap in church programming for adults with autism, who often disappear from church life after aging out of children's programs. Her questioning whether the church sees adult autism as "their responsibility" challenges congregations to examine age-based assumptions in ministry structure. This gap reflects broader societal failures to support adults with autism documented in disability studies literature (Waldock & Forrester-Jones, 2020).
A faith leader (who requested additional anonymity) acknowledged the challenges from the leadership perspective:
"Families sometimes don't understand the pressures we're under. I have congregation members threatening to leave if we make one more accommodation for 'those kids.' I have a board questioning every dollar spent on inclusion when we have a leaking roof. I have volunteers burning out because they're not trained for behavioral challenges. I believe in inclusion with my whole heart, but implementation is messier than anyone wants to admit."
This leader's candid acknowledgment of competing pressures reveals the complex organizational dynamics surrounding inclusion efforts. The reference to congregation members threatening departure over accommodations exposes ongoing resistance to inclusion within faith communities. The leader's statement that "implementation is messier than anyone wants to admit" challenges idealized narratives of inclusion, acknowledging the genuine difficulties leaders face in managing change.
Theme 2.4: Celebrating Small Victories as Community Milestones
Despite tensions and challenges, participants consistently described moments of celebration that united leaders and families in recognizing progress. These celebrations, often around seemingly small achievements, served important functions in sustaining motivation and building collective identity as an inclusive community.
Jennifer Nicholson shared a particularly meaningful celebration:
"When my younger son served as an acolyte for the first time, carrying the candle lighter down the aisle, the entire congregation knew what a victory this was. He had practiced for weeks. The pastor had worked with him personally. When he successfully completed the task, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. The pastor said from the pulpit, 'Today we all witnessed resurrection the movement from 'impossible' to 'look what God has done.' That acknowledgment, that collective celebration, it meant everything."
Mrs. Nicholson's narrative demonstrates how individual achievements become community victories when properly framed and celebrated. The pastor's theological framing of the achievement as "resurrection" elevates a simple task to spiritual significance, helping the congregation understand inclusion as divine work rather than mere social justice. This public acknowledgment validates the family's journey while educating the congregation about the significance of neurodiversity.
Eryn Mera described instituting formal celebration practices:
"We started what we call 'Breakthrough Moments' in our monthly newsletter. With families' permission, we share achievements a child sitting through an entire service, a teen with autism reading Scripture, a young adult joining the choir. But we frame these not as inspiration porn but as testimonies of God's work through community support. It helps our congregation understand that inclusion is happening, even when progress seems slow."
Ms. Mera's careful distinction between celebration and "inspiration porn" demonstrates sophisticated understanding of disability representation ethics. Her framing of achievements as "testimonies of God's work through community support" emphasizes collective effort rather than individual overcoming, avoiding problematic narratives that place burden on individuals with disabilities to inspire others.
SECTION 6: RESEARCH QUESTION THREE - DETAILED FINDINGS
Research Question Three: How did faith communities navigate the challenges and opportunities in creating inclusive environments for individuals with ASD?
The third research question explored the practical dimensions of inclusion implementation, examining specific strategies, resource mobilization efforts, and adaptive processes faith communities employed to create more welcoming environments. The analysis revealed that successful navigation required both systematic planning and improvisational flexibility, with communities learning to balance ideal visions with pragmatic constraints while maintaining momentum toward meaningful change.
Theme 3.1: Adapting Physical and Sensory Environments for Neurodiversity
The modification of worship spaces to accommodate sensory sensitivities emerged as a foundational yet complex undertaking, requiring communities to reconsider long-held assumptions about sacred space design and worship atmosphere. Participants described extensive negotiations between preserving traditional worship elements and creating accessible environments for individuals with autism who experience sensory processing differences.
Eryn Mera provided comprehensive detail about environmental modifications at her multi-site church:
"We've had to think about every sensory element in our worship spaces. Lighting was the first thing we installed dimmer switches in all our children's ministry rooms and created graduated lighting zones in the sanctuary. Some families need to sit where it's darker, others need consistent brightness to avoid visual distraction. We replaced our fluorescent bulbs with LED panels that don't flicker, which seems minor but made a huge difference for several kids who couldn't tolerate the subliminal strobe effect of older lighting. Sound was even more complex. We invested in a professional acoustic analysis and installed sound-absorbing panels designed to look decorative. We created 'sound maps' of our sanctuary showing decibel levels in different sections during worship, so families can choose where to sit based on their sensory needs."
Ms. Mera's detailed account reveals the extensive technical considerations required for meaningful sensory adaptation. Her mention of "graduated lighting zones" and "sound maps" demonstrates sophisticated understanding of how environmental factors affect individuals with autism, moving beyond simple volume reduction to nuanced environmental design. This level of detail aligns with emerging research on worship space accessibility that emphasizes the need for multiple sensory options rather than one-size-fits-all solutions (Bradshaw et al., 2021).
Jennifer Nicholson described the family perspective on environmental adaptations:
"The first time we walked into a church that had a sensory room a quiet space with soft lighting, comfortable seating, and a live video feed of the service I literally started crying. Finally, a church that understood that my son wanting to worship didn't mean he could tolerate the main sanctuary. He could participate without being overwhelmed. And when he felt ready, he could venture out for parts of the service, knowing he had a safe retreat space. That room said, 'You belong here' more than any welcome statement ever could."
Mrs. Nicholson's emotional response to discovering a sensory room illustrates how physical accommodations communicate theological messages about belonging and worth. Her observation that the room "said 'You belong here'" reveals how environmental design serves as embodied theology, making abstract concepts of inclusion tangible. The provision of retreat space that maintains connection through video feed represents sophisticated understanding of the fluctuating nature of sensory tolerance in autism.
Claudette Small, mother of a 32-year-old son with autism who sings in the choir, observed creative adaptations in traditional worship elements:
"Our church started offering 'sensory bags' at the entrance little canvas bags with noise-reducing headphones, fidget items, visual schedules of the service, and even sunglasses for light sensitivity. I watched one Sunday as a mother took a bag, and her whole body relaxed. She told me later it was the first time she felt the church was prepared for her child rather than her always having to prepare her child for church. That shift in responsibility, that's profound."
Ms. Small's observation captures a crucial paradigm shift from expecting individuals with autism to adapt to church environments to churches adapting their environments for neurodiversity. The mother's comment about the church being "prepared for her child" rather than vice versa reflects the Social Model of Disability's emphasis on environmental rather than individual change (Oliver, 2013). The provision of sensory bags as standard equipment rather than special accommodation helps normalize diverse sensory needs.
Carla Hairston highlighted ongoing challenges with environmental adaptation:
"Our church tries, they really do. They've made some changes quieter music, less sudden transitions. But the fundamental assumption is still that 'normal' worship is the default and accommodations are exceptions. My son needs predictability, but every week something changes different worship leader, rearranged furniture, new projection screens. These might seem like minor updates to neurotypical people, but for someone with autism, it can make church feel like a completely different and threatening place each week."
Mrs. Hairston's critique reveals the deeper challenge of moving beyond surface accommodations to fundamental rethinking of worship design. Her point about constant changes that seem minor to neurotypical individuals but significant to those with autism highlights the need for autism-informed decision-making in all aspects of church operations, not just designated inclusion programs. This observation aligns with Thompson-Spratley's (2023) argument that true inclusion requires systemic rather than programmatic change.
Theme 3.2: Developing Sustainable Support Systems Beyond Individual Heroes
Participants consistently emphasized that sustainable inclusion cannot depend on single passionate individuals but requires systematic support structures that can withstand personnel changes, volunteer burnout, and shifting congregational priorities. The analysis revealed ongoing tensions between inspiration-driven initiatives and institutional sustainability.
Dr. Leo Yates articulated the systemic challenge:
"Too often, I see churches where inclusion depends entirely on one dedicated family or one passionate staff member. When that person burns out or moves away, the whole program collapses. We need to move from personality-driven inclusion to systems-driven inclusion. This means written policies, budget line items, multiple trained volunteers, and most importantly, inclusion embedded in the church's mission statement and strategic planning, not just added as an afterthought."
Dr. Yates's analysis identifies a critical weakness in many inclusion efforts dependence on individual champions rather than institutional commitment. His call for "systems-driven inclusion" with concrete elements like budget allocations and strategic planning reflects organizational change principles that emphasize structural over individual solutions. This perspective aligns with Williams (2023) findings that sustainable inclusion requires formal institutional commitment rather than informal voluntary efforts.
Eryn Mera described building redundant support systems:
"We learned the hard way about sustainability. Our first inclusion coordinator was amazing, but when she moved out of state, we realized how much institutional knowledge left with her. Now we have detailed procedure manuals, video training libraries, and always train volunteers in pairs so knowledge is shared. We've created a 'inclusion team' rather than depending on one person. Each team member has specific areas of expertise sensory supports, behavior management, parent communication but everyone knows the basics of all areas. We also partnered with three other churches in our area to share training resources and even volunteers during special events."
Ms. Mera's description of moving from individual to team-based support demonstrates learning from organizational failure. The creation of "detailed procedure manuals" and "video training libraries" represents knowledge management practices essential for institutional memory. Her mention of inter church partnerships reflects creative resource sharing that addresses the limitation of individual congregations, embodying what Ault et al. (2023) describe as collaborative approaches to disability ministry.
Jennifer Nicholson reflected on the burden of being an inclusion champion:
"For years, I was 'the autism mom' at church the one they called whenever any family with special needs showed up. It was exhausting. I was grateful they wanted to help, but I was drowning. Finally, I said I needed to step back, and the church had to decide: was inclusion important enough to survive without me? That crisis forced them to develop real systems. Now we have a team, a budget, and partnerships with local disability organizations. It shouldn't have taken my near-breakdown to get there, but at least we got there."
Mrs. Nicholson's narrative reveals the hidden cost of relying on affected families to drive inclusion efforts. Her description of being "the autism mom" a singular identity defined by her child's diagnosis illustrates how churches often exploit the expertise of families without recognizing the burden this places on them. Her forced stepping back catalyzed institutional change that should have occurred proactively, demonstrating how crises often drive organizational learning in faith communities.
Yvonne Caughman offered perspective on informal support networks:
"Beyond official programs, what's sustained our participation is informal relationships. There's an older couple who unofficially adopted my brother and me. They save our seats, check in during the week, include us in social gatherings. When I have to travel for work, they make sure my brother gets to church. This informal network matters as much as any formal program. Churches need to cultivate these organic relationships, not just create programs."
Ms. Caughman's emphasis on informal support networks highlights a dimension of sustainability often overlooked in formal inclusion planning. Her description of an older couple who "unofficially adopted" them illustrates how intergenerational relationships can provide stability beyond programmatic structures. This observation aligns with research on social capital in faith communities that emphasizes the importance of organic relationships over institutional programs (Sher et al., 2022).
Theme 3.3: Creative Resource Mobilization Within Constraints
All participants acknowledged significant resource limitations financial, human, and spatial yet the analysis revealed remarkable creativity in mobilizing and maximizing available resources. Communities that successfully navigated resource constraints did so through innovative partnerships, repurposing existing resources, and reframing inclusion as investment rather than expense.
A faith leader who requested anonymity shared innovative funding approaches:
"Our church budget was tight it always is. But we reframed inclusion expenses as evangelism and discipleship, which had designated funds. We argued that reaching families affected by autism was evangelism, and supporting their spiritual growth was discipleship. That reframing opened up resources. We also applied for grants from foundations that support disability initiatives, something churches rarely think to do. One $10,000 grant funded our sensory room completely."
This leader's strategic reframing of inclusion as evangelism and discipleship demonstrates sophisticated understanding of church budgeting politics. By aligning inclusion with existing theological priorities rather than treating it as a separate category, they accessed previously unavailable funds. The pursuit of external grants represents entrepreneurial thinking uncommon in traditional church administration.
Eryn Mera described resource-sharing innovations:
"We created what we call a 'inclusion library' that serves multiple churches. We purchased expensive items weighted blankets, communication devices, sensory equipment that rotate between congregations based on need. Five churches contributing $1,000 each gave us $5,000 in purchasing power, but each church gets access to all resources. We also time-share specialists. A behavioral therapist provides consultation to all five churches, with each paying for just a few hours monthly but collectively funding a meaningful position."
Ms. Mera's description of resource sharing between churches represents collaborative innovation that multiplies limited resources. The "inclusion library" concept transforms competitive denominational relationships into cooperative resource stewardship. This model reflects emerging practices in nonprofit collaboration that emphasize collective impact over individual organizational success.
Carla Hairston highlighted the limits of creative resource mobilization:
"I appreciate the creativity, I really do. But sometimes it feels like we're always making do with less while other ministries get full funding. The youth program gets a full-time pastor and dedicated space. The inclusion ministry gets volunteer hours and borrowed rooms. That disparity sends a message about what the church truly values, no matter how creative we get with limited resources."
Mrs. Hairston's critique exposes ongoing inequities in resource allocation that creativity alone cannot address. Her comparison between youth ministry and inclusion ministry resources reveals hierarchies of value within congregational priorities. This observation challenges churches to examine whether resource allocation aligns with stated commitments to inclusion, reflecting Dean's (2025) argument that budgets are moral documents revealing true institutional priorities.
Theme 3.4: Systematic Congregational Education and Culture Change
Participants emphasized that creating inclusive environments required comprehensive education efforts aimed at shifting congregational culture, not just training designated volunteers. This educational process involved formal teaching, experiential learning, and ongoing dialogue about disability, theology, and community.
Reverend Benson described a systematic education approach:
"We realized piecemeal training wasn't enough. We needed comprehensive culture change. So we launched what we called 'Year of Understanding.' Every month focused on different aspects of disability and inclusion. January was disability theology we examined Scripture through a disability lens. February was autism basics we brought in autistic adults to share their experiences. March was sensory processing we had everyone try to worship while wearing noise-distorting headphones and vision-altering glasses. By December, the congregation's entire framework for understanding disability had shifted."
Reverend Benson's "Year of Understanding" represents systematic culture change methodology rarely seen in faith communities. The progression from theological foundation through experiential learning demonstrates sophisticated understanding of adult learning principles. Having autistic adults speak for themselves rather than only hearing from parents or professionals reflects commitment to the disability rights principle of "nothing about us without us."
Dr. Yates emphasized theological education as foundational:
"You can't sustain inclusion efforts without theological grounding. If people see inclusion as mere political correctness or social trend, it won't last. But if they understand it as faithful response to Gospel imperatives, as participation in God's kingdom where the last are first, then it becomes unshakeable conviction. I spend significant time in my teaching connecting disability inclusion to core theological themes imago Dei, the body of Christ, prophetic witness. Once people see inclusion as faithfulness rather than accommodation, everything changes."
Dr. Yates's emphasis on theological education as foundation for sustainable inclusion reflects his academic training and pastoral experience. His connection of inclusion to "Gospel imperatives" and kingdom theology provides religious authority for practices that might otherwise seem optional. This theological grounding aligns with Macaskill's (2021) argument that autism inclusion requires fundamental theological reconstruction rather than surface-level programmatic additions.
Jennifer Nicholson described education from the family perspective:
"The most powerful education happened through relationship. When congregation members got to know my boys personally their names, their interests, their gifts autism became less scary and more human. We started a 'buddy bench' program where neurotypical kids could sit with kids with autism during fellowship time. Those organic interactions taught more than any formal presentation could. One little girl told her mom, 'Timothy doesn't talk much, but he really likes trains and gives the best hugs.' That simple observation did more to normalize autism than hours of training."
Mrs. Nicholson's emphasis on relational education over formal training reflects contact theory principles that suggest personal interaction reduces prejudice more effectively than abstract education. The child's observation about Timothy demonstrates how direct relationship enables neurotypical individuals to see beyond diagnostic labels to human particularity. This approach aligns with Waldock and Forrester-Jones (2020) findings that personal relationships are the strongest predictor of attitude change toward disability.
Claudette Small, mother of a 32-year-old son with autism who sings in the choir, observed gradual culture change:
"It's been slow, but I've watched our congregation change. Five years ago, when a child would vocalize during service, everyone would turn and stare. Now, it barely registers. That's not indifference it's acceptance. We've learned that worship sounds different when everyone's included. Some of our elderly members who were initially resistant have become the fiercest advocates. One gentleman in his eighties told me, 'I fought in Korea for freedom. This is another kind of freedom fight the freedom to worship as God made you.'"
Ms. Small's observation of behavioral changes from staring to acceptance indicates deep culture shift beyond surface compliance. The elderly veteran's reframing of inclusion as a "freedom fight" demonstrates how education can connect inclusion to deeply held values, making it personally meaningful across generational and ideological differences. This transformation aligns with Bass and Riggio's (2006) description of transformational leadership's capacity to reframe organizational challenges in terms of transcendent values.
SECTION 7: RESEARCH QUESTION FOUR 
Research Question Four: In what ways did spiritual beliefs and cultural contexts shape the experience of ASD inclusion within faith communities?
The fourth research question examined how theological frameworks, denominational traditions, and cultural backgrounds influenced approaches to autism inclusion, revealing complex interactions between faith, culture, and disability that both facilitated and hindered inclusive practices. The analysis demonstrated that spiritual and cultural contexts were not merely background factors but active forces shaping every aspect of the inclusion experience.
Theme 4.1: Diverse Theological Understandings of Disability and Difference
Participants articulated varied theological perspectives on autism and disability, ranging from traditional healing paradigms to contemporary neurodiversity theology, with most occupying complex middle positions that evolved through experience and reflection. These theological frameworks profoundly influenced practical approaches to inclusion and shaped how both families and communities understood the spiritual significance of autism.
Dr. Leo Yates provided systematic theological analysis:
"Within Christianity alone, we have vastly different theological frameworks for understanding disability. Some traditions emphasize healing and wholeness, viewing disability as something to be overcome through faith. Others embrace a theology of suffering that sees disability as participation in Christ's passion. Still others are developing neurodiversity theology that sees autism as part of God's intended creation diversity. These aren't just abstract doctrinesthey directly impact whether a church prays for 'healing' from autism or celebrates neurodivergent ways of being. I've seen families devastated by healing services that failed to 'cure' their child, and I've seen others liberated by theology that affirms their child as created in God's image exactly as they are."
Dr. Yates's taxonomy of theological approaches demonstrates how doctrine shapes lived experience for families affected by autism. His observation about families "devastated by healing services" reveals the potential harm of theologies that frame autism as deficiency requiring divine intervention. This analysis aligns with Brock's (2020) critique of cure-oriented theology and advocacy for disability-affirming theological frameworks.
Reverend Benson shared her personal theological evolution:
"My seminary training didn't prepare me for raising a child with autism. I had to deconstruct and rebuild my entire theological framework. I grew up with prosperity gospel influences if you have enough faith, God will fix everything. When my son's autism wasn't 'fixed' despite countless prayers, I faced a crisis. Either my faith was insufficient, God didn't care, or I needed new theology. Through reading disability theologians and listening to autistic Christians, I came to understand that my son doesn't need fixing the church does. His autism isn't a flaw in God's creation but part of creation's beautiful diversity. That shift changed everything about how I pastor."
Reverend Benson's theological journey from prosperity gospel to neurodiversity-affirming theology illustrates the reconstructive work many parents undergo. Her conclusion that "the church needs fixing" rather than her son represents a fundamental shift from medical to social model thinking within theological framework (Oliver, 2013). Her engagement with autistic Christians' perspectives demonstrates the importance of disabled voices in theological development.
Carla Hairston articulated ongoing theological tensions:
"I believe God loves my son exactly as he is, autism and all. But I also pray for his struggles to ease the anxiety, the social isolation, the employment challenges. Is that contradictory? Maybe. But that's the reality of living with disability holding multiple truths simultaneously. Some days I see his autism as a gift that makes him see the world uniquely. Other days, when he's struggling, I question everything. Faith isn't about having perfect theology but wrestling honestly with life's complexities."
Mrs. Hairston's willingness to embrace theological paradox reflects mature faith that resists simplistic answers. Her distinction between accepting autism while praying for associated challenges to ease demonstrates nuanced thinking that avoids both cure-oriented and romanticized perspectives on disability. This theological complexity aligns with Leidenhag's (2021) argument for theological approaches that honor the full range of disability experiences.
Yvonne Caughman offered perspective on how theological beliefs shape family dynamics:
"In our Caribbean cultural background, there's strong belief in divine healing and miracles. Some relatives still believe if we had enough faith, my brother would be 'normal.' They mean well, but it's hurtful. They see his autism as spiritual failure rather than neurological difference. We've had to develop our own theology that honors our cultural heritage while affirming my brother's neurodiversity. We say God already performed the miracle giving us eyes to see my brother's gifts that others miss."
Ms. Caughman's navigation between cultural theological traditions and contemporary neurodiversity perspectives illustrates the complex work of contextual theology. Her reframing of the "miracle" from cure to perception shift demonstrates creative theological work that maintains cultural connection while resisting harmful beliefs. This negotiation reflects what Kang-Yi et al. (2018) identify as the challenge of navigating between cultural and biomedical explanatory models for autism.
Theme 4.2: Cultural Attitudes, Stigma, and Acceptance Variations
Cultural backgrounds significantly influenced how families experienced autism inclusion, with participants describing vast differences in disability understanding and acceptance across ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic contexts. These cultural variations created additional layers of complexity in developing inclusive practices that honored diverse cultural perspectives while challenging harmful stigmas.
Jennifer Nicholson addressed cultural stigma directly:
"In some cultures within our diverse congregation, disability is seen as shame on the family, sometimes even as punishment for sin. We had a family from [specific culture removed for privacy] who kept their autistic daughter hidden for years because of cultural shame. When they finally brought her to church, they sat in the very back, ready to flee at any sign of judgment. It took months of intentional welcome and education to help them feel safe. We had to address not just autism acceptance but cultural shame, working with leaders from their ethnic community to provide culturally sensitive support."
Mrs. Nicholson's description reveals how cultural stigma compounds the challenges of autism inclusion. The family's physical positioning in the back of the church, "ready to flee," embodies their marginal status and fear of judgment. The need for culturally specific intervention through ethnic community leaders demonstrates that generic inclusion approaches may fail to address culturally rooted barriers.
Dr. Yates analyzed socioeconomic dimensions of inclusion:
"We have to acknowledge that inclusion looks different across socioeconomic contexts. Wealthy suburban churches can afford sensory rooms and specialized staff. Urban churches serving low-income communities may struggle to keep lights on, much less invest in inclusion programs. But I've seen remarkable inclusion in under-resourced churches where it's relational rather than programmatic. One inner-city church I work with can't afford fancy accommodations, but they've created a culture where difference is normal because everyone's struggling with something. Sometimes poverty creates solidarity that wealth doesn't."
Dr. Yates's analysis challenges assumptions that inclusion requires significant financial resources. His observation that "poverty creates solidarity" suggests that shared struggle may facilitate acceptance of disability in ways that privilege does not. This perspective aligns with Dean's (2025) findings that working-class churches often demonstrate more organic inclusion despite fewer formal programs.
Eryn Mera discussed navigating cultural diversity in inclusion programming:
"Our congregation includes families from over thirty different national origins. What works for white suburban families might not work for immigrant families from different cultural contexts. We learned this when our support group, run in English only, attracted only white families despite our diverse congregation. We had to reimagine inclusion through multiple cultural lenses. Now we have Spanish-speaking autism support groups, materials translated into multiple languages, and cultural liaisons who help families navigate both autism and American religious culture simultaneously."
Ms. Mera's recognition that inclusion programs initially served only white families despite congregational diversity reveals how systemic inequities replicate even in well-intentioned inclusion efforts. The development of multilingual and culturally specific supports demonstrates commitment to what Drakeford and Majebi (2024) call "intersectional inclusion" that addresses multiple marginalized identities simultaneously.
Theme 4.3: Faith as Coping Resource and Source of Meaning
Participants consistently described faith as essential to navigating autism's challenges, though the specific ways faith functioned as resource varied considerably. For some, faith provided explanatory frameworks for understanding disability; for others, it offered community support; and for many, it sustained hope during difficult periods.
Jennifer Nicholson articulated faith's sustaining role:
"There were days when faith was all that kept me going. When my sons were both melting down, when the developmental pediatrician gave another discouraging prognosis, when I felt completely alone—I would cry out to God, sometimes literally. Not for healing, but for strength to make it through another day. My faith gave me a framework for understanding suffering not as punishment but as part of living in a broken world that God is redeeming. That redemption happens partly through us learning to love and include those the world rejects."
Mrs. Nicholson's description of faith as daily sustenance rather than dramatic intervention reflects lived theology developed through struggle. Her theological framework that positions inclusion as participation in God's redemptive work elevates caregiving from burden to ministry. This meaning-making aligns with research on religious coping in disability families that finds meaning-making more predictive of well-being than belief in divine intervention (Burnett, 2021).
Reverend Benson reflected on faith's transformative potential:
"Autism has deepened my faith in ways I never expected. It's stripped away superficial religion and forced me to wrestle with fundamental questions: What does it mean to be human? How do we bear God's image? What is the purpose of gathered worship? My son's autism has been my greatest theological teacher. Through him, I've learned that God speaks in many languages, including silence. I've learned that worship can be rocking and humming as much as singing and praying. I've learned that the kingdom of God looks a lot more like my son's special needs classroom than most church services."
Reverend Benson's framing of her son as "theological teacher" inverts traditional hierarchies of religious knowledge. Her expansion of what constitutes worship and divine communication challenges neurotypical assumptions about religious expression. This theological learning through lived experience exemplifies what Bowman (2021) calls "autism theology" theological insights that emerge specifically from engagement with autism.
Carla Hairston described faith community as essential support:
"It's not just belief in God but the community of believers that sustains us. When my son was diagnosed in his twenties, our small group rallied around us. They didn't offer platitudes or false hope they offered presence. They learned about adult autism, adjusted their gathering style to accommodate him, and most importantly, they included him as himself rather than trying to make him fit their mold. That tangible love made God's love real during a devastating time."
Mrs. Hairston's emphasis on community presence over theological answers reflects the importance of embodied faith in disability experience. The small group's willingness to adjust their practices rather than requiring conformity demonstrates practical theology that prioritizes relationship over religious form. This community support aligns with research showing that social support mediates the relationship between religious involvement and well-being in disability-affected families (Sher et al., 2022).
Theme 4.4: Inclusion as Prophetic Witness and Spiritual Calling
Many participants framed inclusion work not as optional ministry but as essential witness to gospel values, positioning autism inclusion within broader traditions of prophetic justice and divine preference for marginalized populations. This theological framing provided motivation during challenges and legitimacy when facing resistance.
Dr. Yates articulated inclusion as prophetic witness:
"Churches that genuinely include individuals with autism are engaging in prophetic witness against culture that values productivity, conformity, and independence above all. When we welcome those who may never contribute financially, whose behavior disrupts our comfort, who require more than they can give we're embodying gospel values that challenge both society and church. This isn't charity; it's testimony to God's kingdom where the last are first and the weak shame the strong."
Dr. Yates's positioning of inclusion as "prophetic witness" elevates it from programmatic addition to essential church identity. His reference to biblical themes of reversal—"last are first"—provides scriptural authority for practices that might otherwise seem countercultural. This prophetic framing aligns with contemporary liberation theology that positions God as preferentially aligned with marginalized populations (Brock, 2020).
Eryn Mera described inclusion as vocational calling:
"I didn't choose disability ministry—it chose me. When I saw families leaving church because their children weren't welcome, I couldn't ignore it. It felt like God saying, 'This is your work.' Not everyone is called to specialized disability ministry, but every Christian is called to welcome the stranger and love the marginalized. Autism inclusion isn't a special interest; it's basic Christianity. The fact that it seems radical reveals how far we've strayed from Jesus's example."
Ms. Mera's narrative of being "chosen" by disability ministry reflects traditional calling narratives while challenging the marginalization of inclusion work. Her assertion that inclusion is "basic Christianity" rather than specialized ministry reframes it as central rather than peripheral to church mission. This perspective echoes Northouse's (2018) argument that transformational leadership involves returning organizations to core values they've abandoned.
Reverend Benson offered a powerful concluding reflection:
"Every Sunday when I watch my son participate in worship in his own beautiful way—maybe rocking, maybe humming, maybe flapping his hands in joy—I see the kingdom of God breaking into our conventional world. His presence challenges our definitions of normal worship, proper behavior, acceptable praise. He's a prophet in his own way, calling the church to expand its imagination about who belongs and how we encounter the divine. If the church can't include someone like my son, it's not really the church."
Reverend Benson's description of her son as "prophet" radically reframes autism from deficit to gift, from problem to revelation. Her conclusion that a church excluding autistic individuals "isn't really the church" makes inclusion a matter of ecclesial authenticity rather than optional benevolence. This theological claim aligns with disability theologians who argue that church without disabled members is incomplete and unfaithful to its calling (Macaskill, 2021).
SECTION 8: SUPPLEMENTARY FINDINGS AND COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY
Supplementary Findings
Beyond the themes directly addressing the research questions, several additional findings emerged that provide crucial context for understanding the full complexity of autism inclusion in faith communities. These supplementary discoveries, while not fitting neatly within the primary research questions, offer essential insights that deepen understanding of the phenomenon and suggest important directions for future investigation.
The Invisibility of Autistic Adults
A striking pattern across interviews was the relative absence of programs and support for adults with autism, revealing an assumption that autism is primarily a childhood condition despite its lifelong nature. Carla Hairston's experience with her adult son diagnosed in his twenties exemplified this gap:
"Once you age out of children's ministry, you become invisible. There's no young adult program for someone who can't drive, can't navigate typical social events, needs support to participate. My son is 26, but cognitively and socially, typical adult programming doesn't fit. He's too old for youth group, too young for senior ministries, and adult classes assume independence he doesn't have. It's like the church doesn't know autistic adults exist."
This invisibility of autistic adults reflects broader societal failures documented by Waldock and Forrester-Jones (2020), who note that services cliff dramatically after age 21. The absence of lifespan perspective in church programming suggests theological and practical work remains to address autism across developmental stages.
Sibling Experiences as Hidden Dimension
The experiences of neurotypical siblings emerged as a significant but often overlooked dimension of family inclusion. Yvonne Caughman's unique perspective as both sibling and roommate revealed complex dynamics:
"Growing up, I was the 'responsible one,' the translator between my brother and the world, including church. I loved my brother, but I also resented the attention his needs required. Now as adults living together, I see how my whole life has been shaped by his autism—my career choices, my relationships, my faith. Churches focus on parents and the child with autism, but siblings need support too. We carry unique burdens and gifts that churches rarely acknowledge."
Ms. Caughman's narrative reveals how autism affects entire family systems across lifespans. Her role as "translator" suggests siblings often serve as bridges between neurotypical and autistic worlds, developing skills and perspectives that could benefit inclusion efforts if recognized and supported.
Gender Disparities in Autism Recognition and Support
Several participants noted gender differences in how autism was recognized and supported within faith communities. Jennifer Nicholson observed:
"My boys' autism was recognized early because they fit the stereotypical presentation—difficulty with eye contact, repetitive behaviors, social challenges. But I've watched girls with autism in our church go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years because their autism presents differently. They're seen as 'shy' or 'anxious' rather than autistic. This means they don't get the support they need, and their families don't connect with autism resources."
This observation aligns with emerging research on gender disparities in autism diagnosis, with girls often diagnosed later or missed entirely due to different presentation patterns and diagnostic bias toward male presentations (McCrossin, 2022).
The Role of Technology in Facilitating Inclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated technological adaptations that unexpectedly benefited many individuals with autism. Eryn Mera reflected:
"The pandemic forced us online, and we discovered that some individuals with autism who couldn't tolerate in-person worship thrived in virtual formats. They could control volume, take breaks, type comments rather than speak. Even as we've returned to in-person worship, we've maintained hybrid options. Technology isn't replacement for in-person community, but it's a valuable additional pathway for participation."
This discovery of technology's potential suggests that post-pandemic churches have new tools for inclusion that extend beyond physical accommodation to multiple modes of participation.
Intergenerational Dynamics in Inclusion Attitudes
Contrary to stereotypes about generational attitudes, participants described complex patterns where both resistance and support crossed generational lines. Claudette Small, mother of a 32-year-old son with autism who sings in the choir, observed:
"You'd think older members would resist inclusion, but some of our strongest advocates are grandparents who remember when their own children were excluded for different reasons—maybe divorce, pregnancy outside marriage, mental illness. They say, 'We're not making those mistakes again.' Meanwhile, some younger members who pride themselves on being progressive get uncomfortable when inclusion requires actual sacrifice or disruption."
This observation challenges assumptions about age-based attitudes toward disability, suggesting that lived experience with exclusion may be more predictive of inclusion support than generational cohort.
Summary
This chapter has presented comprehensive findings from a phenomenological investigation of autism inclusion in faith-based communities, drawing from in-depth interviews with church leaders, parents, and family members who have navigated the complex terrain of creating and sustaining inclusive religious environments. The analysis, guided by four research questions and informed by an integrated theoretical framework combining the Social Model of Disability with Servant and Transformational Leadership theories, has revealed the multifaceted nature of inclusion as both profound challenge and transformative opportunity for faith communities.
The findings demonstrate that autism inclusion in faith communities represents far
SECTION 8: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Summary
This chapter has presented comprehensive findings from a phenomenological investigation of autism inclusion in faith-based communities, analyzing in-depth interviews with seven participants including church leaders, parents, and family members navigating disability inclusion. The analysis revealed complex patterns across four research questions, demonstrating that meaningful inclusion requires fundamental transformation rather than surface-level accommodation.
Regarding Research Question One, participants' meaning-making processes revealed transformative journeys from isolation to belonging, though these paths were neither linear nor predictable. Jennifer Nicholson's evolution from excluded parent to special needs ministry leader, Reverend Benson's theological reconstruction following her son's diagnosis, and Carla Hairston's ongoing navigation of adult autism services illustrated how families and leaders develop new frameworks for understanding disability within faith contexts. The analysis revealed that participants moved beyond conventional definitions of success, recognizing diverse forms of worship participation as equally valid expressions of faith.
Research Question Two's exploration of shared experiences between leaders and families uncovered both convergence and tension in collaborative efforts. While participants valued partnership, they also described significant challenges arising from mismatched expectations, resource limitations, and differing priorities. Eryn Mera's development of buddy programs, Jennifer Nicholson's advocacy for sustainable systems, and Yvonne Caughman's emphasis on informal support networks demonstrated that successful inclusion emerges through sustained relationship rather than programmatic solutions alone.
The third research question's focus on practical navigation revealed extensive creativity in addressing environmental, financial, and human resource challenges. Churches implementing sensory adaptations, developing volunteer training systems, and creating innovative funding mechanisms demonstrated that resource limitations, while real, need not prevent meaningful inclusion. However, Carla Hairston's critique of persistent inequities and Dr. Yates's emphasis on systemic rather than personality-driven change revealed ongoing structural challenges requiring institutional commitment beyond individual passion.
Research Question Four's examination of spiritual and cultural contexts exposed profound theological diversity in understanding disability, from healing paradigms to neurodiversity celebration. Cultural stigma created additional barriers for some families, while faith simultaneously served as essential coping resource. Dr. Yates's systematic theological analysis, Reverend Benson's personal faith reconstruction, and participants' framing of inclusion as prophetic witness demonstrated how spiritual beliefs both complicate and motivate inclusion efforts.
Supplementary findings revealed critical gaps in adult autism services, overlooked sibling experiences, gender disparities in recognition and support, technology's emerging role, and complex intergenerational dynamics that challenge stereotypes about inclusion attitudes. These additional insights suggest that autism inclusion intersects with multiple dimensions of family, community, and institutional life in ways that extend beyond traditional disability ministry frameworks.
The findings collectively demonstrate that autism inclusion in faith communities involves navigating multiple tensions: between ideal visions and practical constraints, between individual needs and collective worship, between theological tradition and contemporary disability understanding, and between incremental progress and systemic transformation. Participants' narratives revealed that these tensions, rather than being problems to solve, constitute the ongoing work of inclusion that requires continuous negotiation, adaptation, and grace.
The phenomenological analysis has preserved participants' voices while identifying essential structures of the inclusion experience. The journey from isolation to belonging, the redefinition of meaningful participation, the development of sustainable support systems, and the integration of faith with disability reality emerged as core dimensions of how faith communities engage with autism. These findings suggest that successful inclusion requires attention to individual meaning-making, relational dynamics, practical resources, and theological-cultural contexts simultaneously.
As data collection continues with additional participants, these preliminary findings provide foundation for deeper understanding of autism inclusion in faith communities. The themes identified here will be further refined and validated through ongoing analysis, with particular attention to voices and experiences not yet fully represented in the current sample.
This chapter's findings have significant implications for multiple stakeholders. For faith leaders, the results emphasize the need for theological education about disability, systematic rather than personality-dependent inclusion efforts, and recognition that families affected by autism offer essential expertise for developing meaningful programs. For families, the findings validate their experiences of both struggle and transformation while highlighting the importance of collaborative advocacy rather than isolated effort. For theological educators and denominational leaders, the results suggest that curriculum and policy must address autism as theological and pastoral priority rather than specialized interest.
Chapter Five will discuss these findings in relation to existing literature, examining how they confirm, extend, or challenge current understanding of disability inclusion in religious contexts. The discussion will explore implications for leadership development, theological education, and congregational practice while acknowledging study limitations and proposing directions for future research. The ultimate aim remains developing actionable insights that enable faith communities to become spaces where individuals with autism and their families experience genuine belonging, meaningful participation, and spiritual flourishing within the diverse body of Christ.
The journey toward authentic inclusion, as these findings reveal, is neither simple nor swift. It requires theological courage to challenge traditional norms, practical wisdom to navigate resource constraints, relational commitment to sustain long-term effort, and spiritual vision to see beyond current limitations toward God's inclusive kingdom. Yet as participants' testimonies demonstrate, this journey, however challenging, leads toward richer, more faithful communities that better reflect divine love for all people, regardless of neurological difference. In the words of Reverend Benson, when churches genuinely include individuals with autism, "we see the kingdom of God breaking into our conventional world," transforming not only those who are welcomed but those who learn to welcome.
