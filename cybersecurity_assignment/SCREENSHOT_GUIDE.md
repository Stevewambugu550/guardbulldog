## Tips for Good Screenshots

### DO:
- ✅ Capture full page or relevant section
- ✅ Make sure text is readable
- ✅ Include website URL in browser bar
- ✅ Use descriptive file names
- ✅ Save as PNG or JPG format
- ✅ Make sure no personal passwords are visible

### DON'T:
- ❌ Include other browser tabs with sensitive info
- ❌ Show your email/password fields
- ❌ Capture blurry or tiny screenshots
- ❌ Include unrelated content
- ❌ Forget to save with proper names

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't access Google Search Console"
**Solution:** Just screenshot the login page - it shows the tool exists. Or use the "Remove Outdated Content" tool instead which doesn't require login.

### "Facebook won't let me see certain settings"
**Solution:** Screenshot what you CAN see. The assignment just needs to show you understand the process.

### "Website is down or changed"
**Solution:** Use alternative sites:
- Instead of PrivacyDuck: Use Abine.com or OneRep.com
- Instead of Whitepages: Use Spokeo.com opt-out
- Document which alternative you used

### "Screenshot is too large"
**Solution:** 
- Resize in Paint: Image → Resize → 50%
- Or use online compressor: tinypng.com
