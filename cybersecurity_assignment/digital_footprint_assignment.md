## Part 1: Current Digital Footprint Analysis (10 points)

### Search Query: "Vheekie Ufuoma Ubogu" / "Victory Ubogu"

After conducting a comprehensive Google search of my name, I discovered several pieces of personal and professional information publicly available online. Below are five specific examples of what was found:

---

### Example 1: Facebook Profile - Personal Information Exposure

**Website:** Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/vheekie.norfhureh)

**Information Found:**
- Full name: Vheekie Ufuoma Ubogu
- Educational background: Studies Master of Science at Bowie State University
- Previous education: Studied Computer Science at Regent University
- Location: Lives in Hyattsville, Maryland
- Profile is publicly accessible without login

**Privacy Concern:** This Facebook profile reveals significant personal information including current residence, educational institutions, and academic program. This information could be used for social engineering attacks, identity theft, or targeted phishing campaigns. The fact that this information is accessible without authentication means anyone can view my location and educational background.

**Screenshot Location:** [See Screenshot 1 - Facebook Profile Result]

---

### Example 2: Background Check Website - Age and Phone Number

**Website:** CyberBackgroundChecks.com (https://www.cyberbackgroundchecks.com)

**Information Found:**
- Full name: Victory Ubogu
- Age: 25 years old
- Location: Lanham, MD
- Phone number: (240) 413-8057
- Possible relatives: Joshua O Ubogu

**Privacy Concern:** This is extremely concerning as a third-party background check website has aggregated my personal information including my phone number, exact age, location, and family connections. This information was compiled without my explicit consent and is available to anyone who searches my name. This data could be used for:
- Unwanted marketing calls
- Identity verification fraud
- Stalking or harassment
- Social engineering attacks targeting family members

**Screenshot Location:** [See Screenshot 2 - CyberBackgroundChecks Result]

---

### Example 3: Business Registration - Professional Information

**Website:** Bizapedia (https://www.bizapedia.com)

**Information Found:**
- Business name: VHEEKIE HAIRWAYS LLC in New Carrollton, MD
- Registered agent: Victory Ufuoma Ubogu
- Business address: Apt 103 7745 Riverdale Road, New Carrollton, MD 20784
- Business registration status and filing information

**Privacy Concern:** This business registration reveals my home address (apartment number included), full legal name, and entrepreneurial activities. While business registrations are public record, having this information easily searchable on Google means:
- My residential address is publicly exposed
- Anyone can find my exact apartment number
- This creates physical security risks
- Could be used for mail fraud or identity theft

**Screenshot Location:** [See Screenshot 3 - Bizapedia Business Registration]

---

### Example 4: Educational Records - Academic History

**Information Found Across Multiple Sources:**
- Current enrollment: Master of Science program at Bowie State University
- Previous degree: Computer Science at Regent University
- Academic timeline and progression visible
- Institutional affiliations publicly listed

**Privacy Concern:** While educational achievements are often shared professionally, having this information publicly indexed allows:
- Verification of my background without my knowledge
- Potential employers or malicious actors to research me without consent
- Social engineering attacks using institutional affiliations
- Targeted phishing emails pretending to be from these universities

**Screenshot Location:** [See Screenshot 1 - Facebook showing educational background]

---

### Example 5: Business Listings - Online Presence and Appointment Scheduling

**Website:** Multiple platforms including MapQuest, Acuity Scheduling, Square, Instagram

**Information Found:**
- Business name: Vheekie Hairways LLC / Vheekie Hairways Braids
- Multiple online listings with full address
- Business started in 2017
- Active appointment scheduling system (app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule/4d9fb471)
- Instagram business account: @vheekie_hairways
- Square booking site with deposit requirements
- MapQuest business listing with specialties and history
- Business operates in both Hyattsville and New Carrollton locations

**Privacy Concern:** Having an active business with online presence creates multiple exposure points:
- **Appointment scheduling links** could be exploited by malicious actors to gather information about availability and patterns
- **Multiple platform listings** mean information is duplicated across the internet, making removal difficult
- **Business address is residential address** - clients and anyone online can find home location
- **Instagram business account** may reveal personal photos, location tags, and customer interactions
- **Payment systems** (Square, Acuity) are linked to personal financial accounts
- **Business reviews or complaints** could appear on public forums
- **Operating hours and availability** patterns are publicly visible, creating security risks

**Screenshot Location:** [See Screenshot 4 - MapQuest business listing]
[See Screenshot 5 - Instagram business profile]

---

### Example 6: Social Media Aggregation - PeekYou People Search

**Website:** PeekYou.com (https://www.peekyou.com/_ubogu)

**Information Found:**
- Aggregated social media profiles across multiple platforms
- Links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok profiles with surname "Ubogu"
- Potential family members and relatives with similar names visible
- Cross-platform identity linking
- Historical social media activity indexed

**Privacy Concern:** People search aggregators like PeekYou create comprehensive digital profiles by:
- **Linking multiple social media accounts** to create a complete picture of online presence
- **Exposing family connections** by showing other people with the same surname
- **Preserving historical data** even after accounts are deleted or made private
- **Enabling stalking** by providing a one-stop directory of all online profiles
- **Bypassing privacy settings** by indexing publicly available information
- **Creating association networks** that reveal relationships and connections

This type of aggregation is particularly dangerous because it:
- Consolidates information scattered across platforms
- Makes it easy for anyone to find all your online accounts
- Can reveal patterns and connections you didn't intend to make public
- Is difficult to remove (requires opt-out from each aggregator)

**Screenshot Location:** [See Screenshot 6 - PeekYou search results]

---

### Example 7: Location Data - Residential Information

**Information Found:**
- Current residence: Hyattsville, Maryland (from Facebook)
- Previous/business location: New Carrollton, MD (from Bizapedia)
- Specific apartment address: Apt 103, 7745 Riverdale Road
- Geographic movement patterns visible
- Business operates from residential address

**Privacy Concern:** The combination of current and previous addresses creates a geographic profile that reveals:
- My movement patterns and residential history
- Exact apartment location creating physical security risks
- Ability for strangers to locate me physically
- Potential for stalking, burglary, or other crimes
- Insurance companies or landlords could use this for background checks
- **Business clients have my home address** creating additional exposure

**Screenshot Location:** [See Screenshots 1, 2, and 3 - Multiple sources showing location data]

## Analysis Summary

The digital footprint analysis reveals significant privacy vulnerabilities across **7 major categories**:

1. **Personal Identifiers:** Full name, age, phone number are publicly accessible
2. **Location Data:** Both current and previous addresses including apartment number
3. **Family Information:** Relatives' names are exposed on background check sites
4. **Educational Records:** Complete academic history is searchable (Bowie State, Regent University)
5. **Professional Activities:** Business ownership and registration details are public
6. **Business Operations:** Active online business with appointment scheduling, payment systems, and multiple platform listings
7. **Social Media Aggregation:** People search engines have compiled comprehensive profiles linking all online accounts

**Key Findings from Extended Research:**

**Business Exposure:**
- Vheekie Hairways LLC has active presence on at least 5 platforms (MapQuest, Instagram, Square, Acuity Scheduling, Bizapedia)
- Business started in 2017 and operates from residential address
- Appointment scheduling links are publicly accessible
- Instagram business account (@vheekie_hairways) may contain photos and location data

**Social Media Aggregation:**
- PeekYou.com has indexed and linked multiple social media profiles
- Shows potential family members with surname "Ubogu"
- Creates cross-platform identity profile
- Difficult to remove due to automated web scraping

**Geographic Tracking:**
- Multiple sources confirm exact residential address (Apt 103, 7745 Riverdale Road)
- Business operates from home, exposing address to all clients
- MapQuest listing includes business history and specialties
- Location appears on at least 4 different websites

**Overall Risk Assessment:** **CRITICAL** - The combination of personal identifiers, exact location data, business operations from home address, active appointment scheduling systems, and social media aggregation creates severe risk for:
- Identity theft and fraud
- Physical security threats (stalking, burglary)
- Social engineering attacks
- Business-related harassment or scams
- Financial account compromise through linked payment systems
- Privacy invasion through comprehensive online profiling

**Immediate Action Required:** The residential address being tied to business operations is particularly concerning and should be addressed immediately by using a virtual office address or registered agent service for business listings.
