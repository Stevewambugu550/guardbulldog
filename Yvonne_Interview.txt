============================================================

00:04 
OK, so as I was saying, it's going to be kept for about five years, according to my school. 

00:10 
They want me to have it on file if I need it for whatever. 

00:14 
and um during the questions if there's any question i'm asking you like you're not 

00:21 
comfortable with or you don't want to answer just you know we can just move right on just let me 

00:26 
know if it doesn't apply say i ask you something that not you know it's not applicable to you 

00:31 
and were you able to do the link yeah i did submit the okay all right so i'll look at that 

00:37 
when i'm done but that's just basically what i wanted to say to you and at this point in time 

00:42 
we're gonna begin the questioning 

00:46 
Okay, so how do you and your family experience inclusion? 

00:52 
I think among the various kind of church organizations we've been a part of through my lifetime, there hasn't been necessarily anything that has made us feel excluded. 

01:02 
And that might just be because, you know, my sibling who is on the spectrum is very high functioning. 

01:08 
So to others who don't know him, it might come off as not a social or just a quiet person, you know. 

01:15 
And so I think a lot of the communities we've been a part of have been very welcoming and they don't they don't. 

01:20 
push in a way. 

01:22 
I know in church we're all about fellowship and getting to know each other, 

01:24 
but I think there's been a good amount of patience. 

01:28 
That's involved and I think helps a lot. 

01:28 
Okay. 

01:30 
So was he classified? 

01:31 
or how was he classified? 

01:33 
Is he Asperger or what? 

01:35 
To my knowledge, when he was younger, he was told he was like kind of borderline. And then when he was older, I believe he did a test that classified him, but I'm not sure what level it is specifically. He's kind of been a little bit more private about that information. 

01:52 
So I will be seeing you. 

01:56 
Oh, okay. 

01:56 
So he's living on his own, functioning. 

01:59 
How is he now? 

02:01 
Yes, so actually we're roommates now, and that is mostly because when I moved to New York, 

02:07 
I needed somewhere to stay where I was in school, and one of his roommates was moving out, so I moved in. 

02:13 
For the most part, he is fine on his own. 

02:15 
There are a few small things that are, when it comes to decision-making, that take a little bit of extra time, 

02:22 
or cleaning and processing when it comes to doing tasks and things like that, 

02:27 
that in terms of motivation to do things, but also just like the, 

02:34 
we were talking yesterday, the other day, about an avoidance practice. 

02:38 
So he was saying for him, it's better if I don't bring up things because it'll make him not want to do it. 

02:42 
want to do it. 

02:44 
at least he's honest about 

02:46 
yeah he's like i need to make a list and then go down the list 

02:49 
okay like that's how he sometimes will be most productive 

02:53 
yeah they're pretty efficient high functioning very efficient so could you share like a story 

03:00 
that illustrates um what inclusion looks like um how welcoming it was or have been 

03:11 
Um, well, this past year, we went to a church conference and a lot of, you know, everybody was saying hello and making conversation. 

03:20 
And, you know, when he was off in his corner to him, though, nobody was like in his face trying to bother him. 

03:26 
And, you know, they were very understanding about giving him space and not being like, what's wrong with him? 

03:32 
And, you know, that kind of thing that sometimes people would do. 

03:32 
you know 

03:35 
That was very comforting to do that. 

03:38 
Is there anything you notice, like noise or light or being in front or being the focus, the main focus? 

03:48 
Have you noticed anything like that? 

03:51 
He definitely prefers sitting in the back. 

03:53 
There was a point during service where one of the prophets had a word for him and let him know before he gave his sermon that after the sermon that he was going to have a word for him later. 

04:07 
And from his words to me, he said it made him very anxious and literally, like, made his stomach start hurting. 

04:15 
And so sometimes we've also been in spaces where he will have headphones on. 

04:22 
So how has your family member been involved in inclusion? 

04:26 
How have you seen it affect him? 

04:28 
Or how has it affected you, looking on the side like looking in? 

04:33 
Um, I definitely think he he will volunteer sometimes to help with certain things, but he doesn't want to be the center of it, you know. 

04:43 
And so I welcome whatever help he wants to give to certain activities and things. 

04:50 
Try not to push too hard when it comes to his inclusion or taking the spotlight for anything. 

04:54 
Like we had to do a skit for something this past spring and I had to be one of the actors. 

04:54 
like we had 

05:01 
And he was like, well, I'll help set up, but don't write me into your skit at all. 

05:07 
He did not want to. 

05:08 
part of it that way 

05:08 
okay so what element make you feel more um connected to the community seeing him because 

05:16 
you've been around um his life right you've seen him so what what aspect of community 

05:22 
meaning church community has he been in church all his life you 

05:26 
We did grow up in church. I have been able to see the differences in terms of our social levels when it comes to those settings. 

05:36 
I'll have a lot of friends, even to this day, who I'm still close with, who we grew up with in church. 

05:43 
And I think socially he did not maintain those lasting relationships outside of that. 

05:50 
And so, like, he was more... 

05:51 
to himself unless he was kind of forced to be involved in those different groups. 

05:56 
okay based on his you know um difficulties i may say what what how can you describe a 

06:05 
moment that was just meaningful that you've seen him overcome 

06:10 
Um, year before last, there was an event where someone wanted to pray for him and he seemed not as standoffish about standing in the front and getting prayed for. 

06:23 
So that was a nice moment and it felt meaningful. 

06:27 
And I don't know if it's how he was, I don't know if it's the language that was used when they asked him if he wanted to come forward or what it was, but he seemed more. 

06:38 
more uh willing so how have these experiences shaped your your spiritual journey your growth 

06:48 
Um, I definitely will say it has given me, it has definitely been a lesson on patience. 

06:54 
As I learned to adjust to his, to understanding sometimes his mindset when it comes to certain things and working through things and, you know, trying not to be frustrated in different elements. 

07:06 
But I'm just like, well, why can't you just, you know, because you have to kind of in a way remap your own brain on how to react and not to react to them in those moments. 

07:16 
Bye. 

07:18 
But I think for me, it is also giving me opportunities to lean in more to my word because I'll need like, you know, reassurance or if I am feeling frustrated, figuring out how to pray about that and navigate that spiritually instead of, you know. 

07:34 
So have you encountered any challenges or affirmation? 

07:41 
Um, I think earlier on when we started living together, like in adulthood, you have expectations of how you expect someone to act as an adult. 

07:51 
And I think just overcoming my own frustrations and understanding of it and how to navigate it, just because like growing up, there wasn't a lot of discussion or information necessarily about it and how to deal and live with somebody on the spectrum. 

08:07 
And so it was to me just like working through my own understanding of it, doing my own reading and research and, you know. 

08:16 
So do you think the church is, 

08:18 
there's more people in your church 

08:19 
that are on the spectrum or disabled? 

08:25 
Um... 

08:27 
possibly potentially yes i think you can see it sometimes when people socialize or don't socialize 

08:33 
and that is not to diagnose anyone with anything but you you notice different intricacies in people 

08:38 
that you know once upon a time people would just say oh that's just how they are they are 

08:43 
you know they got a lot of energy or you know 

08:47 
Yeah. So have you interacted with any community individual or being influenced by them in this aspect of disability? 

09:00 
Um, there is one woman who does bring her son. 

09:05 
He is wheelchair bound and I'm not sure about his intellectual capabilities, but he was 

09:12 
nonverbal. 

09:13 
And so when we were at the event, it was just because at the time I was doing photography 

09:18 
and videography for the event. 

09:20 
And it was like how to navigate, how to, because they were like near where the camera was, so I had to move around a lot. And so it was like being conscious of him and where he was, being respectful to both of them. And, you know, giving a little bit of patience when they had to move or maneuver around in his chair and things like that. 

09:39 
So you're saying the aspect is what you're saying. 

09:41 
Like, have you seen any challenges? 

09:42 
So you're saying that was like a challenge. 

09:44 
Have you seen any challenging in participating in religious services? 

09:49 
Like that was a challenge for you, you would say? 

09:51 
And I think, you know, she was, I could tell that even his mother was hesitant to, like when we had an altar call, she was hesitant to leave him on his own or be in certain places. 

10:01 
And I think the, what is it? 

10:05 
It's when it comes to like, even when I was recording sometimes, like even though he's nonverbal, he would still make noises. 

10:12 
And in my head, I'm like, okay, I'll have to edit out that part of the video or do certain things like that. 

10:17 
Because you were close to him. 

10:19 
Because they came and they sat over near where all the recording equipment was. 

10:22 
And so I was mine. 

10:24 
of that. 

10:25 
Okay. So can you describe any specific barriers you think the family face? 

10:33 
I think spiritually when it comes to my mom and I will have a lot of deeper conversations about faith and our approach to things like that. 

10:44 
And I don't know if my brother is as open when it comes to those conversations or as receptive to certain advice. 

10:53 
You know, I think in his brain, he tries to map out his own path to where he's going. 

10:58 
And sometimes when we chime in and give him advice, I don't think he thinks we completely understand where he's coming from. 

11:05 
And so sometimes it makes giving him advice a little bit difficult. 

11:10 
Okay, so how would you think he described his journey growing up in a church family 

11:16 
and knowing that your family is spiritual? 

11:21 
And, you know, do you think that he had like a good experience with church? 

11:28 
Um, for the most part, I would say, yeah, because there was a time where we, not we were forced to go to church, but my mom was adamant that we were present every Sunday. 

11:40 
So I think when he got into his teenage years, I think his... 

11:45 
The teenage mood and emotions on top of everything else. 

11:49 
My mom kind of gave him a little bit more leeway. 

11:52 
And so I think that was an interesting period for sure for everybody. 

11:56 
But I also think just his own social capabilities and other people's expectation of those social capabilities might have made things a little bit more difficult. 

12:05 
But I think he was willing to a certain degree to have conversations and commune with everybody else. 

12:11 
But he definitely would like to go off on his own and be in the quiet away from everything else. 

12:14 
and why do we 

12:15 
And I have. 

12:15 
and how 

12:17 
And I have experienced like in services where he will put on like either earplugs or headphones or something if something's like too loud or overstimulating, especially with like live music. 

12:28 
So have you noticed any challenges that impaired your participation or your family's participation over the years because of, you know, a distraction or constantly have to paying attention to what's going on with him? 

12:43 
Like you're telling me, like the mother did. 

12:46 
Do you remember any encounters like that? 

12:50 
not to my knowledge okay i think sometimes there is 

12:57 
for me overcoming like for me sometimes how can i put this like if he doesn't feel well sometimes 

13:03 
it makes me a little anxious about things like that and so there is sometimes like if he's not 

13:08 
at an event because he doesn't feel where he doesn't want to be there um maybe a little 

13:14 
off-centered a little bit mentally when I'm there but I think we've given him a lot of leeway where 

13:21 
we're not forcing him to be physically present at some of those events and stuff so 

13:26 
Okay. Were there any solutions your family or yourself found effective? 

13:34 
Um, I definitely think, like, not forcing him to be places was effective because then he was more willing later to come and participate at things. 

13:44 
Um, and I think, you know, meeting him where he was at a certain period of time, because if it was like, oh, you know, he didn't sleep well the night before, he didn't do whatever. 

13:54 
And I think also like knowing now that people on the spectrum are more susceptible to things like anxiety and all those kind of things has given me an idea of like where not to overstimulate them sometimes. 

14:06 
Or like having patients when he is overstimulated to understand that he's in that atmosphere where he needs like less. 

14:12 
yes it's helped a lot okay so how does your cultural background influence your expectation 

14:20 
or lack thereof or do you think there's was a lack in it in your you know your expectation 

14:27 
I mean, I think the expectation, especially among more African-American church families, is everybody's social. 

14:36 
Everybody's a very close-knit community. 

14:37 
Everybody, to a degree, knows everything about everyone. 

14:41 
And it's not, I guess. 

14:44 
this is not a super wildly discussed thing. 

14:46 
Like, we don't really necessarily talk about it 

14:48 
outside of the family in terms of, like, direct, like, 

14:51 
oh, yes, he's on the spectrum type of language, you know? 

14:56 
And I think, you know, growing up when it comes to mental health or anything that is considered not normal, it's always, oh, we'll just give to the Lord the prayer about it and not necessarily seeking. 

15:07 
professional care or sitting or breaking what the church recognizes as traditions, you know. 

15:15 
Okay. So how has your cultural background shaped your interaction with your community? 

15:26 
I'm trying to think if there was anything specific that I felt like I wouldn't do. 

15:36 
was not 

15:37 
a part of this background. 

15:46 
Any specific aspect influenced you? 

15:49 
Based on you with your family, you know, as opposed to seeing a church member, would you, you know, would you feel the same way? 

16:00 
Would you have the same influence or, you know, expectation? 

16:06 
Can you repeat the question again just to make sure I understand what you're asking? 

16:10 
How has your cultural background shaped your interaction with your community, meaning the church community? 

16:17 
I feel like I'm a lot more social among them. 

16:20 
I think there's a lot of respect for the elders in a way that might be different in different cultural groups. 

16:26 
So there's a lot of going to them for advice about certain situations and things. 

16:36 
in terms of 

16:39 
involvement in things there's a lot of 

16:41 
expectations for how involved people are 

16:43 
and I don't know if that's the same 

16:45 
for other groups and I mean that 

16:47 
in a way where it's like oh if you are 

16:49 
new to a community or church they want you 

16:51 
to 

16:53 
oh they found you can sing oh you want to be on the praise team 

16:55 
oh they found you can dance oh you should 

16:57 
dance and do this oh 

16:58 
your brother's tall he can help us put up all the signs 

17:01 
and it's like the expectation is 

17:03 
you are locked in from the jump 

17:06 
All right. So how has your inclusion experience affected your view of community? 

17:19 
Um, personally, I think how welcoming everyone is has definitely given me a positive aspect of community, at least within the ministry I'm involved in. 

17:29 
I know what people who are, I guess, under different characterization at church might have a different point of view. 

17:41 
I do have a younger cousin who I see, you know, a few times during the holidays who is a little more nonverbal. 

17:50 
She does talk, but not a ton. 

17:52 
And so, like, she's still very involved in the church that my grandma takes them to. 

17:57 
And so that's been kind of a relief and a good thing to witness is her involvement because they let her sing in the choir and they let her dance from time to time. 

18:06 
So that's been good to witness, I think. 

18:08 
For me, thankfully, most of the organizations and churches we've been a part of are very welcoming. 

18:13 
But I also think that is something I say out of privilege because my brother is very high functioning. 

18:19 
And for others, I'm not sure if there's that same openness and welcomeness or I know, especially like historically, especially among the African-American community. 

18:28 
It is if you are different, you are not at the forefront of things on purpose, you know. 

18:35 
So I think, you know, it's been. 

18:40 
experience so what changes have you observed in within your church community because 

18:51 
Disability and autism is huge now. 

18:54 
It wasn't before years ago. 

18:56 
But are you noticing any change within the church community? 

19:02 
I think there are more discussions. 

19:05 
I think there are more people are willing to not break tradition, but not be astringent in them, you know? 

19:17 
And I think definitely there's always room for improvement. 

19:26 
So what suggestion would you... 

19:31 
say, what would you suggest 

19:33 
to improve inclusion for people 

19:37 
that are disabled or on the spectrum? 

19:40 
Maybe there are additional resources provided for service. Like I know sometimes they're not necessarily like a lot of churches don't really have like interpreters or closed captions on things or there may not be any specific ministry groups for those people to be involved in and people who are not fully able-bodied. 

20:06 
Or, for example, people who don't want to be in the spotlight, maybe the preacher has to change how they give them, you know, words of prophecy. 

20:14 
Or, you know, 

20:14 
Or, you know, any type of advice instead of in the middle of service, you know? 

20:20 
Do you think that there will be in the future changes to accommodate people that are on the spectrum and that are disabled? 

20:33 
Prayerfully, yes. I'm not sure because it really depends on, you know, what the various churches want to commit and invest in. 

20:42 
And if, for example, you know, a lot of parents or caregivers will, to a degree, keep their children or the people they're caregiving for like at home more often than not, instead of bringing them in. 

20:58 
And so if the church organization doesn't feel like those people are physically present enough, will they want to invest in the upgrade to the changes? 

21:08 
And it really is like, how bad do you want everyone to be physically in your building? 

21:16 
So how could you, how could communicating? 

21:19 
can be improved. 

21:20 
in that aspect. 

21:22 
Um, I think if leadership is willing to listen to people who are, you know, listen to people's lived experiences, understand the need for change and adjustment and potentially be, I'll say, less glued to traditions, you know, because everybody isn't the person who needs to be called on to pray or do, you know, do those type of things. 

21:49 
And so if they are, be volunteers. 

21:54 
So what additional support would benefit your family? 

22:03 
You know, it'd be interesting to have services that respect the how overstimulating church can be sometimes because there's music sometimes depending on what's going on. 

22:16 
There's people running around and falling out and doing all that type of stuff. 

22:20 
And for certain people, that is a lot. 

22:22 
And it pulls them out of the experience and the connection with. 

22:26 
whatever spiritually is going on in that space. 

22:28 
So if there is, I don't want to say an alternative space 

22:32 
or some type of place where people can experience church 

22:35 
without all the bells and whistles. 

22:40 
like that just visualize that when you said that it's true and some people are not like 

22:46 
people are disabled or on the spectrum are not equipped for that 

22:51 
So what additional support? 

22:52 
Well, we said that already. 

22:53 
How do you see your role in supporting inclusion initiative? 

23:00 
Say you were elected. 

23:02 
We see you have the qualities of initiating inclusion. 

23:08 
What would you do? 

23:11 
I would start by fostering conversations and really hearing from people who, you know, have those lived experiences on, you know. 

23:18 
Because it is a spectrum and there are a range of... 

23:22 
Disabilities and wages of able. 

23:25 
body capabilities i think definitely like fostering conversation and hearing from those 

23:29 
people people who may feel like they they're silent or no one really cares enough or sees them 

23:36 
to hear about their perspective so definitely like talking to them and seeing what they have 

23:40 
to say what recommendations they have because I feel like a lot of people who 

23:44 
assume leadership think that their ideas are always the best and they should go with that 

23:50 
but I think definitely hearing from others and getting their input 

23:54 
And then just kind of logistically, like mapping out, you know, what the progression of implementing those things are, how do we ease people into it? 

24:03 
Because we know humans are terrified of change. 

24:06 
And if it's something that benefits other people. 

24:08 
People, right. 

24:09 
So it's like, how do we adjust in a way that is realistic, but also not delaying the care and support and resources people need? 

24:20 
So what action do you think should be taken, though, as coming from the leader down? 

24:28 
Does he know what's going on or what's needed or what's the latest in community? 

24:36 
In community, I think. 

24:38 
I think pastors have got to be more one-on-one with people. 

24:42 
I feel like in the past, churches were more personal. 

24:48 
And now when we got into the era of megachurches, there's been a lot of impersonal. 

24:54 
feelings to it. So I feel like people have really got 

24:56 
to get 

24:58 
down off the pulpit and go talk to the 

25:00 
people and see what's really going on. 

25:01 
And see what's really going on. 

25:03 
their church. 

25:03 
community. 

25:03 
and also just be vigilant you know 

25:05 
when you're a leader and you have your 

25:07 
co-pastors or your deacons or any of those 

25:09 
people you have to ask you know in your meetings 

25:11 
first of all have those church meetings 

25:13 
but ask like is there anything in our 

25:15 
community that we're lacking is there any group we 

25:17 
feel like we're overlooking you know 

25:21 
So what role do you think Karen's playing in all of this? 

25:24 
Um, good day. 

25:26 
I mean, they're definitely advocates for their children or those they're giving, providing care to, whether that's the child or a family member. 

25:37 
I definitely, you know, obviously, depending on the capability of the person, they can't speak for them necessarily. 

25:45 
And if that person is capable of it, they can kind of be the middle ground to help them communicate their feelings and thoughts on things. 

25:53 
But, you know, definitely an advocate and a protector in a way, because some people will try to do good for the vanity sake of, look what we did, you know, so. 

26:03 
What skills do you think should be developed? 

26:09 
It's not a school. 

26:10 
We understand that. 

26:11 
Spiritually, yes. 

26:15 
But what tools, what skills do you think that should be developed? 

26:20 
You should be nurtured. 

26:20 
while they're in church. 

26:29 
I would say maybe, and even, you know, even neurotypical people still deal with it, but like 

26:40 
just applying like context to what you're learning in church, because we were talking about it in 

26:45 
my church now, it's like the context of the scriptures, because like, if you don't have 

26:50 
the context, you are reading the Bible from a very surface level type of thing, and so like, 

26:55 
even if it's like having a better understanding of the scriptures and the words, and maybe it's 

27:00 
extra breakdowns from what your pastor is talking about each week, you know, or if it's definitions 

27:05 
of words and things of that nature, if possible, and if applicable to the person, like public 

27:11 
speaking, because a big part of faith is, you know, giving testimony, it's how to pray, 

27:20 
even if it's just in your room, how to find those words. 

27:23 
It is for some, you know, the Great Commission telling others about the Lord, you know. 

27:32 
and in the bible they speaks about the disabled and the blind so god has a passion for them as 

27:39 
well so what advice would you give a faith community um beginning um inclusion journey like myself 

27:56 
There's still ongoing research and data. 

27:59 
We know this across any health field, but talk to the professionals. 

28:04 
Talk to the people who have been researching these groups for years, you know, see what input they have. 

28:11 
And, you know, all of their advice might not be applicable to a church or a church community, but they still have, you know, the basis of information and foundation. 

28:19 
And you once you have like a more solid foundation, you can start saying, OK, how does this apply to a faith community? 

28:25 
You know, we've seen how they have navigated it and built programs in schools. 

28:30 
How did what does this look like for a church? 

28:35 
So what key considerations should a beginner keep in mind in addition to what you just said? 

28:44 
There's always emerging information, nothing you learn or think you understand is set in stone because there's always ongoing studies and data and policy and all that kind of stuff. 

28:59 
And so once you start building, you have to be aware of where your resources are coming from. 

29:03 
Because as we've seen currently, even with the current administration, the changes and the grants and the dollars and the resources available might shift and change. 

29:12 
What's recommended in terms of treatment, care, and programs might shift and change. 

29:18 
And so you have to build something that if you go from having $1,000 to $500, what would that program look like? 

29:29 
So you would say, how effective would an inclusion journey engage families, knowing that there's a lot of people at home who don't want to go to church because their children make these noise and people may feel, you know, make them feel. 

29:48 
They don't want to feel unfair. 

29:50 
or ashamed about it. 

29:51 
So what would you say to someone like that? 

29:56 
What could be done for someone like that 

29:59 
to make them start coming out? 

30:02 
I mean, I would definitely be forthcoming about, you know, we understand this is what you might be feeling. 

30:11 
We recognize that there are obviously, you know, difficulties and adjustments that need to be made to our traditional service to help better serve you. 

30:21 
If it's having a separate space for them where they can still feel engaged, if it's coaching the rest of the congregation on how to react. 

30:30 
And so I said it every time I make a noise, everybody's looking back at them. 

30:33 
You know, you create an understanding where it's not like they feel ashamed or like a spectacle for being present. 

30:43 
And so I think it's a conversation with them, but also a conversation with your body about how you treat and react to them in those spaces. 

30:53 
how old is that child um i want to say he is 

31:02 
He's at least late teens, early 20s. 

31:05 
And he's the only one you have in your church that's disabled or autistic. 

31:10 
Um, I'd say there are levels of ability in the church because there are, and this is 

31:17 
potentially due to age and different ailments, but there are people who use canes or walkers 

31:23 
and things of that nature. 

31:25 
Um, you know what? 

31:26 
No, there is one other woman who has an adult daughter who has MS and she is wheelchair 

31:31 
She's not present at a lot of things, but she does have to come to some of the bigger 

31:35 
annual events because of that. 

31:38 
But she is verbal and, you know. 

31:43 
I think that was a later in life type of shift from being more able-bodied to being in the wheelchair. 

31:53 
Well, that concludes the questions that I've had. 

31:55 
that I've had. 

31:56 
asking, so were there any questions I asked 

31:58 
that were unclear or confusing 

32:00 
to you? 

32:06 
yeah no everything made sense for the most part i think i was trying to figure out 

32:15 
how culture fully implicates and shifts experiences but 

32:21 
Yeah. But do you agree that your culture shapes how you, you know, interact or? 

32:27 
Yeah, for sure. And I think, you know, depending on the makeup of your church, the reaction to people or their need for resources varies, you know. 

32:37 
And for the most part, I've grown up in very black church groups and communities. 

32:42 
I did go to summer camps where I was more of a minority in those settings. 

32:48 
But to my knowledge, there were not children who were on the spectrum or of any handicapped status. 

32:59 
Because that was one of those camps where you were ripping and running through the woods for two weeks. 

33:03 
that wasn't happening 

33:05 
so was there any 

33:06 
that you think I should have asked that I didn't? 

33:17 
Not that I can think of off the top of my head. 

33:20 
So how was the flow and the pacing of the interview? 

33:24 
You know, they give you a window of 60 to 90 people, minutes. 

33:28 
Some people take longer, some of them, of course, you're younger. 

33:31 
People, you know, may elaborate more, but how did you think it went? 

33:36 
I think it went fine. I think for some questions, giving space for elaboration might be good. 

33:45 
Or asking, is there anything else before we move on to the next question might be helpful. 

33:49 
Because, you know, there might be a thought that they didn't immediately think of in their first response. 

33:52 
But they're like, oh, and that, you know. 

34:00 
But I also think the makeup of the faith communities is an interesting question to think about too. 

34:06 
Because like culture, your culture can impact how you feel in your faith community. 

34:10 
But if you are a minority, for example, in a more diverse church or say you are African-American and people you go to church with are mostly white or. 

34:23 
especially because I live near New York 

34:24 
so there are like Korean churches 

34:26 
and you know all kinds of stuff 

34:27 
All kinds of guys. 

34:28 
So definitely the interaction and the experience in those settings. 

34:32 
are to a degree twofold yeah so do you agree that there is a huge lack of knowledge 

34:41 
when it comes to inclusion and what it looks like 

34:47 
Yeah, for sure. And I think, you know, like I was saying, the church has their traditions and things that they don't even think about or recognize, you know. 

34:57 
And, you know, when it comes to even mental health, there are there's a lack of. 

35:01 
how we discuss it and talk about it. 

35:05 
And people don't. 

35:05 
realize that's a disability as well. 

35:09 
And I think the conversation about therapy and professional support versus prayer and how those things can work together, and I think there is, you know, a gap there, too. 

35:20 
Okay. Do you have any other suggestions or how I could improve as I move along? 

35:35 
I don't know I would potentially open it up maybe to like for example for me like I'm not a what 

35:42 
you could call a traditional caregiver you know because I'm a sibling and so you might be able to 

35:48 
get more respondents if you have it where it's like oh you're in close relationship with this 

35:51 
where it's like, oh, you're in class. 

35:54 
person you've seen them you know through things but you're not gonna say like a parent you know 

35:58 
Which was good for you to have you as well. 

36:02 
A co-parent, because I'm sure, you know, you've helped your mom, your family member. 

36:08 
Yeah. And it's interesting, too, because I'm a younger sibling, so that's a different dynamic, too. 

36:14 
So your feedback is crucial in helping me to, you know, get to the next step with this, with my research. 

36:21 
And as I said, this will be kept for five years. 

36:25 
And I'm going to do the transcript. 

36:31 
And if you would like, I can send you a copy of it before I go forth and start my research. 

36:37 
But it won't be done until I gather all my information from everyone. 

36:42 
Then I start doing my transcript. 

36:43 
So that's up to you. 

36:44 
I can always send you a copy so you can review it before I go to my next step. 

36:51 
Yeah, that'd be nice. And you know, for the most part, I don't think I would be asking to change anything. I think I spoke transparently from what I wanted to say. 

36:56 
Scott Trish 

36:59 
So if there's anything, I'll be there. 

37:01 
You know, and if there's anything you, after you be through everything, you feel like we were missing something or you need me to answer something again, let me know. 

37:11 
I think it's funny to be more 

37:11 
Thank you so much. 

37:13 
straightforward in any of my response. 

37:14 
because they're more directed 

37:14 
because they're more dramatic. 

37:15 
to the question. 

37:16 
you did very well and I appreciate it 

37:18 
you know what I mean because 

37:20 
You had a lot to say, you know, because some people don't realize young, it's not just the younger person, older person, young people, they have experience as well. 

37:29 
You're in the household, you're in community, community and church, you know what I mean? 

37:34 
So I'm going to stop the recording.
