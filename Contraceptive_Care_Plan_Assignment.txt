**Introduction**

Developing safe, effective, and patient-centered contraceptive care plans is a cornerstone of advanced practice nursing. Family Nurse Practitioners (FNPs) must possess the clinical acumen to navigate complex patient profiles, integrating evidence-based guidelines with individual patient needs, preferences, and risk factors. This paper will analyze two distinct patient cases—a 37-year-old smoker and a 42-year-old woman with a history of migraine with aura—to demonstrate the application of the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria (U.S. MEC) for Contraceptive Use. For each case, appropriate and contraindicated contraceptive options will be identified, counseling strategies based on shared decision-making will be discussed, and a comprehensive care plan will be documented in a SOAP note format.

**Case Study 1: Smoker >35 Years**

**Patient Profile:** 37-year-old, smokes ~10 cigarettes/day. History: No chronic conditions, but occasional migraines (without aura). Goal: Desires a low-maintenance, long-term contraceptive.

**1. Summary of Health Status, Goals, and Risk Factors**

This patient is a 37-year-old woman whose primary reproductive goal is to secure a low-maintenance, long-term contraceptive method. Her significant risk factor is her age combined with her smoking status (≥35 years and smoking <15 cigarettes per day). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this combination significantly elevates her risk for cardiovascular events, particularly venous thromboembolism (VTE) and ischemic stroke, if using estrogen-containing contraceptives (Curtis et al., 2024). Her history of migraine without aura is also a key consideration, although it carries a lower risk profile than migraine with aura.

**2. Appropriate Contraceptive Options**

Given the patient's desire for a low-maintenance, long-term method and the contraindication to estrogen, the following options are most appropriate:

*   **Levonorgestrel Intrauterine System (LNG-IUD):** This is a top-tier option as it is highly effective, long-acting (3-8 years depending on the device), and progestin-only, posing no increased risk of cardiovascular events for this patient. The U.S. MEC assigns it a Category 1 (no restrictions) for women over 35 who smoke (Curtis et al., 2024). It is low-maintenance and aligns perfectly with her goals.
*   **Contraceptive Implant (Etonogestrel):** The implant is another excellent long-term (3 years), low-maintenance, and highly effective progestin-only method. It is a U.S. MEC Category 1 option for this patient, as it avoids the systemic risks of estrogen (Curtis et al., 2024). It requires no user adherence after placement.
*   **Copper Intrauterine Device (Cu-IUD):** As a non-hormonal method, the Cu-IUD is exceptionally safe for this patient (U.S. MEC Category 1). It provides long-term (10-12 years), effective contraception and is immediately reversible. It fully aligns with her request for a low-maintenance method and avoids all hormonal risks.

**3. Contraindicated or Less Appropriate Options**

*   **Combined Hormonal Contraceptives (CHCs):** This includes combined oral contraceptives (COCs), the patch, and the vaginal ring. For a woman aged ≥35 who smokes <15 cigarettes per day, CHCs are a U.S. MEC Category 3 (theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages). If she smoked ≥15 cigarettes per day, it would be a Category 4 (unacceptable health risk) (Curtis et al., 2024). The estrogen component significantly increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and VTE in this population (Novais et al., 2023).
*   **Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA) Injection:** While DMPA is a progestin-only method and U.S. MEC Category 1 for this patient, it may be less appropriate. It is not long-term in the same way as an IUD or implant, as it requires repeat injections every 13 weeks. Furthermore, concerns about potential delays in return to fertility and effects on bone mineral density might make it less ideal than LARC methods for a patient seeking a simple, long-term solution.

**4. Counseling Strategies and Shared Decision-Making**

Counseling should begin by validating the patient's goal for a low-maintenance method and then transparently explaining the cardiovascular risks associated with estrogen-containing methods due to her age and smoking status. Using clear, non-judgmental language is crucial. A visual aid comparing the effectiveness and duration of LARC methods (IUDs, implant) versus other methods can be powerful. The conversation should be framed around her priorities: "You mentioned you want something you don't have to think about daily. The IUD and the implant are the most effective options for that. They also don't contain estrogen, which is the safest choice for you as a smoker." The final decision must be hers, made after a thorough discussion of the risks, benefits, and procedural aspects of each suitable option.

**5. Contraceptive Plan**

The plan would focus on initiating a LARC method. After counseling, if the patient chooses the LNG-IUD, the plan would include:
*   **Education:** Discuss the insertion procedure, expected bleeding changes (irregular spotting initially, likely followed by lighter periods or amenorrhea), and management of potential side effects like cramping. Provide information on checking for IUD strings.
*   **Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up visit 4-6 weeks post-insertion to assess for any issues, check strings, and answer questions. Reinforce that the IUD is effective for several years and does not protect against STIs.
*   **Adherence:** No user adherence is required, which meets her goals.
*   **Cultural/Ethical:** Ensure the patient feels empowered and that her choice is respected without coercion. Smoking cessation counseling should also be offered as a crucial health intervention.

**SOAP Note: Case 1**

**S:** 37 y/o female presents for contraceptive counseling. "I want something I don't have to remember to take every day, something long-term." Reports smoking ~10 cigarettes/day. Denies chronic medical conditions other than occasional migraines without aura. LMP 2 weeks ago.

**O:** BP 118/76, HR 72, BMI 24. UCG negative. STI screening declined at this time. Exam unremarkable.

**A:** Patient is a 37-year-old smoker (<15 cigarettes/day) desiring long-term, low-maintenance contraception. Combined hormonal methods are contraindicated (U.S. MEC Category 3) due to increased cardiovascular risk. Progestin-only or non-hormonal LARC methods are most appropriate.

**P:**
1.  Counseled patient on risks/benefits of LNG-IUD, Cu-IUD, and contraceptive implant.
2.  Patient expressed preference for the LNG-IUD (Mirena) due to potential for lighter menses.
3.  Patient provided with written information and consented to procedure. Mirena IUD inserted today without complication.
4.  Educated on string checks, expected bleeding changes, and when to call the clinic.
5.  Offered smoking cessation resources; patient accepted a pamphlet.
6.  RTC in 4-6 weeks for string check and follow-up.

**Case Study 2: Migraine with Aura**

**Patient Profile:** 42-year-old with a history of migraine with aura. History: Otherwise healthy. Perimenopausal, irregular cycles. Goal: Wants contraception until menopause, also interested in menstrual cycle regulation.

**1. Summary of Health Status, Goals, and Risk Factors**

This is a 42-year-old perimenopausal patient with two primary goals: reliable contraception until menopause and regulation of her irregular menstrual cycles. Her most critical risk factor is her history of migraine with aura, which is an absolute contraindication for estrogen-containing contraceptives due to a significantly increased risk of ischemic stroke (Nappi et al., 2017). Her perimenopausal status and irregular cycles are also key factors influencing the choice of method.

**2. Appropriate Contraceptive Options**

Given the absolute contraindication to estrogen, all recommended methods must be progestin-only or non-hormonal.

*   **Levonorgestrel Intrauterine System (LNG-IUD):** This is an outstanding choice. It is a U.S. MEC Category 1 method for migraine with aura. It provides highly effective, long-term contraception and is very effective at managing irregular or heavy perimenopausal bleeding, often leading to amenorrhea, which would meet her cycle regulation goal (Curtis et al., 2024).
*   **Progestin-Only Pills (POPs):** POPs are a safe option (U.S. MEC Category 1) and can help regulate cycles if taken consistently. However, they require strict daily adherence, which may not be ideal for all patients, and are less effective than LARC methods.
*   **Contraceptive Implant (Etonogestrel):** The implant is another safe and highly effective LARC method (U.S. MEC Category 1). While it can suppress ovulation and stop cycles, its bleeding pattern can be unpredictable, which may not align with her goal of cycle regulation as well as the LNG-IUD.

**3. Contraindicated or Less Appropriate Options**

*   **Combined Hormonal Contraceptives (CHCs):** Any method containing estrogen (pills, patch, ring) is strictly contraindicated. For women with migraine with aura at any age, CHCs are a U.S. MEC Category 4 (unacceptable health risk) due to the synergistic increase in the risk of ischemic stroke (Curtis et al., 2024; Nappi et al., 2017).
*   **Copper Intrauterine Device (Cu-IUD):** While the Cu-IUD is a safe and effective non-hormonal contraceptive (U.S. MEC Category 1), it is a less appropriate choice for this specific patient because it can potentially increase menstrual bleeding and cramping. Given her goal of regulating irregular cycles, a method known to worsen bleeding would not be patient-centered.

**4. Counseling Strategies and Shared Decision-Making**

The primary focus of counseling is to clearly explain the stroke risk associated with estrogen and migraine with aura, establishing why CHCs are not an option. The conversation should then shift to how different safe methods can meet her dual goals. A provider could say, "Because of your migraines with aura, any birth control with estrogen is unsafe due to a high risk of stroke. However, we have excellent estrogen-free options. The hormonal IUD is very popular for women in your situation because it’s great for birth control and also helps make periods lighter and more predictable." Discussing the bleeding profiles of the LNG-IUD (likely lighter) versus the implant (unpredictable) is key to helping her make an informed choice that aligns with her cycle regulation goal.

**5. Contraceptive Plan**

Assuming the patient chooses the LNG-IUD, the plan would be similar to the first case but with an emphasis on its benefits for perimenopausal bleeding.
*   **Education:** Explain the insertion process and emphasize that the IUD will provide contraception and likely regulate her bleeding until she is postmenopausal. Discuss the expected transition from irregular spotting to lighter, regular cycles or amenorrhea.
*   **Follow-up:** Schedule a 4-6 week follow-up. Discuss that the device can remain in place through the menopausal transition. Provide guidance on how menopause will be confirmed while using the device (e.g., age-based recommendations, FSH testing if needed).
*   **Adherence:** No user adherence is required.
*   **Cultural/Ethical:** Empower the patient by focusing on methods that safely meet both of her stated goals, reinforcing her active role in the decision.

**SOAP Note: Case 2**

**S:** 42 y/o female presents for contraceptive counseling. States, "My periods are all over the place, and I need reliable birth control until I'm through menopause." Reports history of migraine with aura, last episode ~6 months ago. Otherwise healthy.

**O:** BP 124/80, HR 68, BMI 26. UCG negative. Pap smear up to date. Bimanual exam normal.

**A:** Perimenopausal patient with migraine with aura, desiring long-term contraception and menstrual cycle regulation. Estrogen-containing contraceptives are contraindicated (U.S. MEC Category 4). LNG-IUD is the optimal choice to meet both contraceptive and non-contraceptive needs.

**P:**
1.  Counseled patient on absolute contraindication of estrogen due to stroke risk with migraine with aura.
2.  Discussed benefits of LNG-IUD for contraception and management of perimenopausal bleeding. Also discussed POPs and implant as safe alternatives.
3.  Patient chose the LNG-IUD (Liletta) to address both goals.
4.  Patient consented and Liletta IUD was placed today. Procedure well-tolerated.
5.  Educated on what to expect regarding bleeding patterns, string checks, and use through menopausal transition.
6.  RTC in 4-6 weeks for follow-up.
